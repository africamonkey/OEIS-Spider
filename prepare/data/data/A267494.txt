        "The T operator numerically summarizes the frequency of digits 0 through 5 in that order when they occur in a number. The numbers and the frequency are written in base 6.",
        "These are all autobiographical numbers in base 6 which lead to a fixed-point or belong to a cycle.",
        "There is one cycle with length 2 (103142132415, 104122232415), all other numbers are fixed-points."
