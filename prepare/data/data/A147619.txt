        "Concat(a,b) means decimal concatenation of a and b, i.e., a*10^[log[10](b)+1] + b, since we do not allow leading zeros in b. However, allowing for leading zeros in b would not give any additional term below 10^6.",
        "This sequence was suggested by Farideh Firoozbakht and David Wilson on the SeqFan mailing list, Oct 27 and Nov 06, 2008.",
        "Farideh Firoozbakht has proved that if n is in this sequence, then n*10 is again in the sequence. Thus one could call \"primitive\" elements of this sequence those which aren't a multiple of 10.",
        "A possible variant would be to allow decomposition of n into an arbitrary number of substrings. If one requires decomposition of n into each of its digits, i.e. the analog of A098771 with sigma replaced by phi, then 78 appears to be the only number having this property."
