        "Presumably there are no further terms.",
        "Proof: We can check explicitly that there is no further term below 1000. Any larger number is of the form n = a*1000 + b, a > 0, with either 0 <= b < 100 (in which case n has a digit '0' and n = n + 0 is not in the sequence) or 87 < b < 1000 in which case b is not in this sequence, thus b = m+d where d is a digit of m and therefore also of a*1000 + m and therefore n = (a*1000 + m) + d is not in this sequence. - _M.
