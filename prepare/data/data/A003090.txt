        "Urzua abstract: \"We start by showing a one to one correspondence between arrangements of d lines in P^2 and lines in P^{d-2}. Then we apply this to classify (3,q)-nets on P^2 for all 2 <= q <= 6. For the new case q=6, we have a priori twelve possible cases, but we obtain that only six of them are realizable on P^2 over C. We give equations for the lines defining these nets. We also construct a three dimensional family of (3,8)-nets corresponding to the multiplication table of the Quaternion group. After that, we define more general arrangements of curves and relate them, via moduli spaces of pointed stable curves of genus zero, to curves in P^{d-2}. Then, we prove that there is a one to one correspondence between these more general arrangements of d curves and certain curves in P^{d-2}. As a corollary, we recover the one to one correspondence for line arrangements. This more general setting not only generalizes line arrangements but also shows the ideas behind what we did in that case.\" - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Apr 05 2007"
