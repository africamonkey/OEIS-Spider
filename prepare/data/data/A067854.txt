Prime(6) = 13 can be appended to the beginning of 3 (in L_5) so that their neighboring digits (i.e. 3s) are equal. Hence L_6 = {2,133,5,7,11} and a(6) = 5. Prime(7) = 17 can be appended to the beginning of 7 in L_6 so that their neighboring digits are equal; so L_7 = {2,133,5,177,11} and a(7) = 5. It would be interesting to have a closed-form expression giving, at least asymptotically or statistically, the value of a(n)."
