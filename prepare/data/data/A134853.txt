        "a(1) to a(9) are equal to A000027. For n>9 the structure of the digits represents a mountain. The first digits are in increasing order. The last digits are in decreasing order. There is only one largest digit which represents the top of the mountain. This sequence is finite. The last member is 123456789876543210.",
        "The sequence is a supersequence of A134941, because the restriction that both feet of the mountain are at \"sea level\" (first and last digit equal 1) is dropped here.",
