        "Comment: All numbers of the form 1+3k (k=0,1,2,...) are in this sequence, since 2(3k+1)+7 = 6k+9 is divisible by 3. Moreover, each of these numbers can be extended to an equidistant sequence of length k+1 and step 2k+3: This leads to the triangle T[k,m] = (3k+1)+(2k+3)*m, m=0,...,k, of elements of this sequence, because T[k,m]*2+7 = (2k+3)(2m+3) is never prime. The lines of the triangle end with m=k since the next term T[k,k+1] would be the same as the term in the following line, T[k+1,k]. (The formula T[k,m]=((2k+3)(2m+3)-7)/2 might also explain the comment involving \"n=(p^2-7)/2\".) [_M. F. Hasler_, Jun 16 2010]",
