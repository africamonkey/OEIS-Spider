        "In Euclidean geometry, a bicentric quadrilateral is a convex quadrilateral that has both an incircle and a circumcircle. The sequence A219192 gives the areas A of bicentric quadrilateral with sides (a,b,c,d), inradius r and circumradius R integer. For any such A, A*k^2 is again an element of A219192 for any integer k>0. Terms in A219192 which are not of that form (with k>1) are called \"primitive\", and listed here.",
        "The term A219192(2) = 9408 is not in this sequence since 9408 = 2^2*2352 and 2352 = a(1).",
        "The term n = 253920 = 2 ^ 5 * 3 * 5 * 23 ^ 2 is divisible by 4^2 and 23^2, but neither of n/3^2, n/5^2, n/23^2 is in A219192, therefore n is in this sequence."
