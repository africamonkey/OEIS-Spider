    "comment": [
        "Since entanglement is not invariant under graph isomorphism, all 2^(n(2n-1))-1 nonzero Laplacian matrices are treated as different.  A nonzero Laplacian matrix not equal to the complete graph is entangled in C^2 x C^n if and only if its complement is.  Since the complete graph is not entangled, this means that a(n) is even for all n."
