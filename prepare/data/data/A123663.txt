        "If one constructs a square (square 1) and then draws another square of identical size beside it (square 2), the squares share 1 edge. If one then places an identical square above square 2 (instead of continuing in a straight path), there are now 2 shared edges. Continuing this pattern in an outward spiral, one finds that the number of shared edges is 4, 5, 7, ...",

        "This sequence is also the maximal number of shared edges among all polyominoes with n square cells.  This is the result of Harary and Harborth cited in the references. Once this is known the formula 2n - ceiling(2*sqrt(n)) comes from geometrical considerations and A027709. Namely, the 4n sides of the n squares making up the polyomino form the perimeter and come together in pairs along shared edges. Hence, 4n = perimeter + 2*shared edges. Maximizing shared edges minimizes perimeter and so maximum shared edges = (4n - minimum perimeter)/2 = (4n - 2ceiling(2*sqrt(n)))/2 = 2n - ceiling(2*sqrt(n)). This interpretation is important to landscape ecologists and is called the aggregation index in the GIS program FRAGSTATS. - _Julian F. Fleron_, Nov 29 2016"
