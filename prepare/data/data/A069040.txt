        "Equivalently, n is relatively prime to the denominator of B(2n). Equivalently, there are no primes p such that p divides n and p-1 divides 2n. These equivalences follow from the von Staudt-Clausen and Sylvester-Lipschitz theorems.",
        "The listed terms are the same as those in A070191, but the sequences are not identical. (The similarity is mostly explained by the absence of multiples of 2, 3 and 55 from both sequences.) See A070192 and A070193 for the differences."
