        "The first differences of a(n) are positive when n is a square (ie. a(n+1) - a(n) > 0) and zero otherwise.  This implies that the square characteristic (A010052) can be written in terms of a(n) as A010052(n) = signum(a(n+1) - a(n)), n > 1.  Furthermore, the number of squares less than or equal to n is given by sum_{i=1..n} signum(a(i+1) - a(i)), and the sum of the squares less than or equal to n is given by sum_{i=2..n} i * signum(a(i+1) - a(i))."
