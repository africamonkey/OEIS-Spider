        "The 3-adic valuations for the terms are 29 and 83, and the 11-adic valuations are 22 and 26. For the other main sequences of trios corresponding to nonsquare semiprimes other than 10 and through 39, including separate prime valuations in companion sequences, see cross-references.",
        "While heuristics imply this sequence is infinite, finding a(3) is difficult: A program counting digits for numbers of the given form restricted to those having an even number of decimal digits (with heuristics and initial data practically ruling out counts of 2 for any digit) produced no result for this sequence through 61 values having no more than one digit counted a nonprime number of times. The last of these values was 3^14650*11^3032 (10148 digits in length). - _James G. Merickel_, Dec 11 2013",
