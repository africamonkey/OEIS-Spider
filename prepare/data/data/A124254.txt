        "In an arbitrarily large pine plantation, a tree with a trunk of radius 1/n is located at each of the lattice points of a square lattice (whose rows are spaced one unit apart), except for one empty lattice point at the center of the plantation. How many tree trunks will be visible to an observer located at the empty lattice point? By symmetry, the number must always be divisible by 8, so a(n) is defined as one-eighth of the number of visible tree trunks. (Each tree trunk is assumed to be a vertical cylinder, centered at its respective lattice point. A tree trunk is considered \"visible\" unless it is completely obscured from view by one or more other tree trunks.)"

(The tree trunk at (4,3) is considered completely obscured by the ones at (3,2) and (1,1), each of which is tangent to the line 4y = 3x.)"
