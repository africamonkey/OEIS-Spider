        "This sequence is known to at least 20 million Skat players. It might be one of the most frequently verbally recited nontrivial sequences, even worldwide. It is used during the bidding process (German \"Reizen\") to determine the declarer. I had already learned the first few terms of this sequence at primary school age watching adults playing Skat.",
        "For the following terms there is no unique correspondence between hand and game value: 36, 48, 60, 72, 90, 96, 99, 108, 110, 120, 132, 144, 168, 180, 192, 216. E.g., 48 may be achieved by the hands \"Grand basic game\" or \"Clubs suit game with three (Jacks)\". (End)"
