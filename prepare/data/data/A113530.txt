A003215(59) = (59+1)^3 - 59^3 = 10621 = 13 * 19 * 43 is not in the sequence, as it is a 3-almost prime [whose prime factors have the same number of digits, a so-called 3-brilliant number, as is (70+1)^3 - 70^3 = 14911 = 13 * 31 * 37; similarly, (87+1)^3 - 87^3 = 22969 = 103 * 223 is called 2-brilliant].
