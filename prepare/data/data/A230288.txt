        "Comment from Jack Brennen: This sequence stops after 123 terms. The 123rd term is 989 which has no possible successor. It looks like many low starting points lead to 989 and halt there. The smallest starting point which goes beyond that seems to be the number 396 (which has no possible predecessor). The sequence beginning with 396 goes on for quite some distance. I traced it up to values in excess of 20 million (over 3 million terms).",
        "Comment from Lars Blomberg: (Start)",
        "1. As for 396, I notice that the first differences of the sequence are: 396,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,11,12,14,8,6,12,14,8,6,12,15, 10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,11,12,14,8,16,12,14,8,17,14,8,16,12,14, 8,16,13,16,12,14,18,16,12,(6,2,4,8) ... repeated indefinitely, which suggests that the sequence started with 396 is infinite.",

        "Comment from Nicolas Graner (Start):",
        "Here is an argument to try to prove that the sequence starting with 396 is infinite.",
        "Starting from 1001 (which is reached from 396), you eventually reach 9995. The next number is 10001, which eventually yields 99995, followed by 100001.",
        "More generally, ake 1x001, where x is any sequence of digits. It will reproduce the sequence from 1001 to 1995, up to 1x995. This is followed by 1y001, with y = X+1. This repeats until x becomes all 9's, at which point the first digit will change: 199..995 -> 200..002.",
        "Now we get numbers of the form 2x002, which reproduce the sequence from 2002 to 2994 while x increases, until it reaches all 9's and the first digit becomes 3.",
        "You can repeat this reasoning with each value of the first digit. There are some subtleties because, when the first digit changes, the last one is not always the same. But since the sequence is very \"robust\" (as evidenced by forking sequences, which reunite pretty quickly), variations in the last digit have no effect beyond a couple of terms.",
        "So starting with 100*001, we are bound to get eventually to 999*995, which is followed with 1000*001 (with one more digit). Which shows that the sequence is almost certainly infinite. (End)",
