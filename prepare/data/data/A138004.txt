        "All nontrivial cycles have the same length when either n is a prime number with primitive root 2 (see A001122) or when all factors of polynomial (x+1)^n+1 (mod 2) have the same multiplicative order. It is conjectured that all terms of this sequence are prime numbers. The cycle lengths for these n are in A138006."
