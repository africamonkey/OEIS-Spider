        "This formula was derived in Mathematica in a Laplacian Hilbert space model using zeta zero like functions to give a spectrum. This specific approach to the Riemann conjecture was suggested by Hilbert himself. Equations for the model are: Phi[n_,s_]=Exp[ -s^2/(4*n)]/n^(s/2)+I*(Exp[ -s^2/(4*n)]/n^(s/2)) H*Phi = \\(d\\_\\(s, s\\)\\[Phi] + V\\[Phi] = E0[n] \\[Phi]\\)\\ \\)\\) E0[n_]=hbar*(1/2+I*b[n]) Solve[V==0,b[n]] Solve[Im[b[n]]==0,s]"
