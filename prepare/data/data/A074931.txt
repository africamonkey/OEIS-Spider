        "Numbers equidistant from consecutive twins (see A074953) are multiples of 3 and they may be almost primes only of form 3*prime. In the sequence, these primes are given. Also: A001748 (3*prime 2-almost-primes) and A001358 (all 2-almost-primes)."

        "17 is in the sequence because 3 * 17 = 51 is equidistant between {41, 43} and {59, 61}.",
