        "Although it initially appears that a(n)-8n = the 16-periodic sequence {-2,-6,-10,-14,-18,-22,-26,-30,-34,-38,-42,-46,-50,-54,6,2}, this pattern eventually breaks down. For example, 2^130-2 is in this 16-periodic sequence, so is followed by A102370(2^130-2) = 2^130-2 + 4 + 2^130. However, the first break occurs somewhere beyond the first 400 million terms."
