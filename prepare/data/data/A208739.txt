        "Gives the number of multisets that occuring as the peak heights multiset of a Dyck (n+2)-path minus the number of multisets occuring as the peak heights multiset of a Dyck (n+1)-path.  We use the definition given by Callan and Deutsch (see reference).  A Dyck n-path is a lattice path of n upsteps U (changing by (1,1)) and n downsteps D (changing by (1,-1)) that starts at the origin and never goes below the x-axis.  A peak is an occurrence of U D and the peak height is the y-coordinate of the vertex between its U and D."
