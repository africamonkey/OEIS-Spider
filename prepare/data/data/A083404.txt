        "Viswanath's constant is not relevant for this sequence, since these two questions are different: what is the growth rate of almost random Fibonacci sequences, what is the average value of the n-th term of such a random Fibonacci sequence? (I've just submitted a paper to Journal of Number Theory to prove that the two problems have different solutions. I'm currently preparing a second paper which gives the explicit value of the constant involved in the context of average value of n-th term.) - Benoit Rittaud (rittaud(AT)math.univ-paris13.fr), Mar 10 2006"
