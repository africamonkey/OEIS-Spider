    "comment": [
        "Let f(0)=m; f(n+1)=1+gpf(f(n)), where gpf(n) is the greatest prime factor of n (A006530). For any m, for sufficiently large n the sequence f(n) oscillates between 3 and 4. Given a sufficiently large n, this allows us to divide integers in two classes: C3 (m such that the sequence f(n) enters the cycle 3, 4, 3, ...) and C4 (m such that the sequence f(n) enters the cycle 4, 3, 4, ...). We present here C4 as the one that begin with 4. In A120684 we present C3 as the one that begin with 3."
