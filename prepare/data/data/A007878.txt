        "Here \"generic\" means that the coefficients are algebraically independent symbols. - _Robert Israel_, Oct 02 2015",
        "At one point it was suggested that this is the same sequence as A039744, but this is wrong. _Dean Hickerson_, Dec 16 2006, comments as follows: (Start)",
        "The claim that A039744 equals the number of monomials in the discriminant is false. The first counterexample is n=4: There are 18 such partitions, but the discriminant has no terms corresponding to the partitions 3+2+2+2+2+1 and 2+2+2+2+2+2, so the number of monomials in the discriminant is only 16.",
        "Columns near the left or right have very few nonzero elements and this adds some restrictions to the partitions.",
        "For example, from column 2 of the matrix, we see that the partition must have at least one term equal to n or n-1. From the last column, it must have at least one term equal to 0 or 1. Maybe the complete list of such conditions is enough; I don't know.",
        "Even if we could figure out exactly which partitions correspond to monomials that occur in the expansion, I can't rule out the possibility that the coefficients of some such monomial could cancel out, further reducing the number of nonzero monomials in the discriminant. (End)"
