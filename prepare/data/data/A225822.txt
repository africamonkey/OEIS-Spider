        "The sequence that includes all numbers along this path is A047522 (numbers congruent to {1,7} mod 8). This is also the same as the odd terms of A199398 (XOR of the first n odd numbers).",

Its base 4 representation is 1313 while the base 4 representation of 120 is 1320. It may be that another workable definition of the sequence is -- numbers n in base 4 representation such that string 1,3 occurs one less time in n+1 than n, but I have not been able to check this.",
        "The difference between the numbers in the sequence is always either 8 or 16, however there appears to be no recurring repetitions in it. Writing the 8 as a 0 and the 16 as a 1 (or dividing the difference pattern by 2 and subtracting a 1) produces a difference pattern of: 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1... which is an infinite word.",
