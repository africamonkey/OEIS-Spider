        "When b = 2, there are 105 solutions less than 10000, and in this case, the sequence of n is dominated by primes: only five of these are composite. The average difference between successive composite terms is near the magnitude of n. n and 2n + 1 account for roughly 3% of primes less than 20 billion. For other bases, n is almost always composite.",
