        "If n > 2 is even, 2^n - 1 is not a prime power, while 2^n + 1 can't be a prime power unless n is a power of 2. The sequence contains all n > 2 such that 2^n + 1 is a Fermat prime (the only known examples being 4, 8, 16). These may be the only even members of the sequence: no nonsquarefree Fermat numbers are known. - _Robert Israel_, Nov 23 2015",
        "All odd terms are prime: if a,b > 1 and odd, 2^(ab)+1 is divisible by 2^a+1, but is not a power of it, and similarly 2^(ab)-1 is divisible by 2^a-1, but is not a power of it. - _Robert Israel_, Nov 24 2015"
