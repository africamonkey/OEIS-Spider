        "Equivalently, this is the number of integer weightings of the edges of the complete graph K_n which are: (1) nonnegative on all triangles; (2) maximally vanishing on triangles; and (3) have gcd of weights equal to one.",
        "This also gives the degree of each anticut in the metric polytope (see link below) for n points."
