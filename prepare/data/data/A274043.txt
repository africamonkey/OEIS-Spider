    "comment": [
        "Empirically, the limit of a(n)/10^n tends to 3/Pi^2 (A104141) and implies that the asymptotic density of squarefree numbers congruent to {1, 2, 3} mod 8 is half that of the asymptotic density of all squarefree integers (A071172). When this sequence is compared with squarefree numbers congruent to {5, 6, 7} mod 8 (A274264) it contains slightly fewer squarefree integers at each of the sampling points, 10^n for n > 1. It can be argued heuristically that, as {1, 2, 3} mod 8 contains a square residue, its equivalence class should contain fewer squarefree numbers.",
        "Also it has been shown, conditional on the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, that all squarefree integers congruent to {5, 6, 7} mod 8 (A273929) are primitive congruent numbers (A006991). However, this property applies only sparsely to squarefree integers congruent to {1, 2, 3} mod 8 (A062695)."
