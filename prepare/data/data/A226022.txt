    "comment": [
        "This sequence arose when looking for an upper bound on the number of parenthesis schemes assuming that schemes of length 4 have exactly two schemes which are equal. The most common example would be working with subtraction. When you subtract (a-(b-c))-d) is equal to (a-(b-(c-d))) so if you count unique parenthesis schemes then for length 4 you would have one less than the Catalan number A000108(3). This sequence counts the maximum number of parenthesis schemes you can have for longer words. This notion can be easily generalized to any schemes that deviate from the Catalan numbers for schemes of any length k. This is related to the depth of a quasigroup."
