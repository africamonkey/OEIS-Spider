        "To prove that a(3) = 58073, we first show that (x+1)^p - x^p - 1 mod p^2, with gcd(x^2+x,p) = 1, has solutions when p = 58073 only for the residues x = r, -r/(1+r), 1/r, -(1+r), -1/(1+r), -(1+1/r) mod p, with r = 1281. By examining the orders of 1+1/r, 1+r, -r mod p, we prove that no x in this equivalence class can satisfy x^x + (x+1)^(x+1) = 0 mod p^2.",
