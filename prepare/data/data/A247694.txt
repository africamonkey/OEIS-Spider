    "name": "Minimal absolute discriminants a(n) of complex quadratic fields with 3-class group of type (3,3), 3-principalization type H.4 (2122), second 3-class group G of even nilpotency class cl(G)=2(n+3), and 3-class tower of unknown length at least 3.",
    "comment": [
        "The 3-principalization type (transfer kernel type, TKT) H.4 (2122) is not a permutation, contains a transposition, and has no fixed point.",
        "The nilpotency condition cl(G)=2n+6 for the second 3-class group is equivalent to a transfer target type, TTT (called IPAD by Boston, Bush and Hajir) of the shape [(3^{n+2},3^{n+3}),(3,3,3),(3,9)^2].",
        "The second 3-class group G is one of two vertices of depth 2 on the coclass tree with root SmallGroup(243,6) contained in the coclass graph G(3,2).",
        "The length of the Hilbert 3-class field tower of all these fields is completely unknown. Therefore, these discriminants are among the foremost challenges of future research, similarly as those of A242873, A247688, A247697.",
        "A247694 is an extremely sparse subsequence of A242878 and it is exceedingly hard to compute a(n) for n>0.",
        "The initial term a(0)=21668 has been recognized as a realization of TKT H.4 in the Dissertation of J. R. Brink(1984). However, Brink did not know that the TKT H.4 can also occur with second 3-class group G=SmallGroup(729,45) of nilpotency class cl(G)=4 and TTT [(3,3,3)^3,(3,9)]. Actually, D. C. Mayer (1991) was the first who proved that the integer 21668 is the smallest term of A247694 and does not belong to A242873."
