        "Binary analog of A003590. More generally, this sequence is the 2nd row of the matrix whose k-th row is the concatenation of the base-k expression of n-th row of Pascal's triangle. The 10th row of that array is A003590. The array begins: k/n..1..2...3....4........5................ 1.|..1..11..1111.11111111.1111111111111111.2^(n-1) repetitions of 1. 2.|..1..11..1101.111111...11001101001...... 3.|..1..11..121..110101...11120111......... 4.|..1..11..121..1331.....11012101......... 5.|..1..11..121..1331.....141141........... 6.|..1..11..121..1331.....14641............"
