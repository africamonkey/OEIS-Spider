        "Since all the Fermat numbers are relatively prime to each other (see link), the probability that a given integer is not a multiple of the first k Fermat numbers is 2^((2^k)-1) / 2^(2^k)-1, the limit of which is .5 as k increases infinitely; therefore the probability that an integer is a Fermat multiple, as well as the probability that it is not, is .5."
