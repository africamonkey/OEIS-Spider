    "comment": [
        "Each determinant is the numerator of the fraction x(n)/y(n) = [1!, 2!, ...n! ] (the simple continued fraction). The value x(n) is obtained by computing the determinant det(n X n) from the last column. The value y(n) is obtained by computing this determinant after removal of the first row and the first column (see example below)."
