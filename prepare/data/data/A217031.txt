        "This sequence relates to the difficulty of computing the factorial in an arithmetic model where adding, subtracting, and multiplying can be done with unit cost.",
        "If this sequence is of polynomial growth -- that is, there exists some c such that a(n) < (log n)^c for all n -- then the factorial is said to be ultimately easy to compute, and consequently \"the Hilbert Nullstellensatz is intractable, and consequently the algebraic version of 'NP != P' is true\" (Shub & Smale). If A217032, the corresponding sequence with k = 1, is of polynomial growth it is instead called easy to compute and the same conclusion follows.",
        "The sequence is nondecreasing by definition."
