        "Yasutoshi Kohmoto observes that prevprime(a(n)) is more frequently congruent to 3 (mod 4) than to 1. This bias can be explained by the possible prime constellations and gaps: To have the same residue mod 4 as a prime in the list, the previous prime must be at a gap of 4 or 8 or 12..., but a gap of 4 is impossible because 12k + 1 - 4 is divisible by 3, and gaps >= 12 are very rare for small primes. To have the residue 3 (mod 4) the previous prime can be at a gap of 2 or 6 with no a priori divisibility property. However, this bias tends to disappear as the primes (and average prime gaps) grow bigger: for primes < 10^5, the ratio is about 35% vs 65% as the above simple explanation suggests, but considering primes up to 10^8 yields a ratio of about 41% vs 59%. It can be expected that the ratio asymptotically tends to 1:1. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 01 2017"
