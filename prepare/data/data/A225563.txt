        "The \"totient-trajectory\" of a number m is the sequence obtained by starting with m and repeatedly applying the map x -> phi(x) (cf. A000010) until reaching 1.",
        "Because all totient-trajectories contain only even numbers apart from the final 1 and (perhaps) the initial term ending in 1, only odd numbers will be in the sequence.",
        "Conjecture: No totient-trajectory can be partitioned into an odd number of sets with the same sum.",
        "Observation: for the first 1000 terms, numbers ending in 5 are more than twice as frequent as those ending in any other number."
