        "Repunits in base 18 are off to a slow start compared with all the repunits in bases from -20 to 20. There are only 4 repunit primes in base 18 with exponents searched up to 150,000 while most other bases have 7-10 by then. Even after scaling the rate by logb logb, this is relatively low. - _Paul Bourdelais_, Mar 12 2010",
        "With the discovery of a(6), this sequence in base 18 repunits is converging nicely to a rate close to Euler's constant with G=0.6667. - _Paul Bourdelais_, Mar 17 2010",
        "With the discovery of a(7), G=0.54789, which is very close to the expected constant 0.56145948 mentioned in the Generalized Repunit Conjecture below. - _Paul Bourdelais_, Dec 08 2014"
