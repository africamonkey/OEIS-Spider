        "The gap of 6 between triplets starting at p=5 and p=11 is the very first gap, so a(1)=5. The gap of 6 between triplets starting at p=11 and p=17 is not a record, so it does not contribute to the sequence. The gap of 24 between triplets starting at p=17 and p=41 is a maximal gap - larger than any preceding gap; therefore a(2)=17."
