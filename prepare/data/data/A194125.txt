        "A CLHCA is a cyclic linear hybrid cellular automaton (defined on p.883 of the Fxtbook, see link below). For fixed n its period depends only on the weight of its rule vector.  The polynomial corresponding to a weight-w length-n CLHCA is x^n+(1+x)^w (or its reciprocal polynomial 1+x^w*(1+x)^(n-w)).",
