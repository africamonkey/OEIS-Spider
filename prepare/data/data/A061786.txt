        "If the {s+t} sums are generated by addition 2 terms of an S set consisting of n different entries, then at least 1, at most n(n+1)/2=A000217(n) distinct values can be obtained. The set of first n squares gives results falling between these two extremes. E.g. S={1,4,9,16,25,36,49} provides 27 different sums of two, not necessarily different squares: {2,5,8,10,13,17,18,20,25,26,29,32,34,37,40,41,45,50,52,53,58,61,65,72,74,85,98}_ Only a single sum arises more than once: 50=1+49=25+25. Therefore a(7)=(7*8/2)-1=27."
