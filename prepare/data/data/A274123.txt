    "example": [
        "Before counting gaps, all gaps are zero, so the first pass happens after the first prime, 2. Up to and including 113, a gap of 2 occurs at least as often as any other gap. At prime 113, the gaps 2 and 4 are the most frequent (both occur 10 times). After 127, the next prime after 113, there is a gap of 4. So at the prime 127, the gap 4 has occurs the most of all gaps. This was not the case at the prime previous to 127 (the prime 113). Therefore, 127 is in the sequence."
