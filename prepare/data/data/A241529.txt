    "comment": [
        "This sequence has a restriction involving 4 variables. More composite cases are described with a better restrictive expression.  The expression for n(a,c,d,z) will force n^2 + n + 41 to be either a fraction or a composite number.",
        "The condition on n(a,c,d,z) was determined by quadratic curve fitting.  It has been automated with the Maple Interactive() command.  The ultimate motivation is to try to find a closed from expression that generates all the composite cases of n^2 + n + 41 for integer n."
