        "Beginning with 1, 23, 45, etc... gives a similar sequence which however grows more quickly. Other sequences can be generated by varying the \"template\" of the succession of digits (such as the decimal expansion of Pi, e, and so on).",

The claim of \"slowest\" requires that after a(1), the smallest possible option must always be used (9899->10010 instead of 9899->100101). - _Danny Rorabaugh_, Nov 27 2015"
