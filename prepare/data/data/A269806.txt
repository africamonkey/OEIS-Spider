    "comment": [
        "In order to define (harmonic) fractility of an integer n > 1, we first define nested interval sequences.  Suppose that r = (r(n)) is a sequence satisfying (i) 1 = r(1) > r(2) > r(3) > ... and (ii) r(n) -> 0.  For x in (0,1], let n(1) be the index n such that r(n+1) , x <= r(n), and let L(1) = r(n(1))-r(n(1)+1).  Let n(2) be the index n such that r(n(1)+1) < x <= r(n(1)+1) + L(1)r(n), and let L(2) = (r(n(2))-r(r(n)+1))L(1).  Continue inductively to obtain the sequence (n(1), n(2), n(3), ... ), the r-nested interval sequence of x.",
        "For fixed r, call x and y equivalent if NI(x) and NI(y) are eventually identical.  For n > 1, the r-fractility of n is the number of equivalence classes of sequences NI(m/n) for 0 < m < n.  Taking r = (1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... ) gives harmonic fractility."
