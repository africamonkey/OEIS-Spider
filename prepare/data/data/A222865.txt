    "comment": [
        "Here \"weakly graded\" means that there is a rank function rk from the vertices to the integers such that whenever x covers y we have rk(x) = rk(y) + 1.  Alternate terminology includes \"graded\" and \"ranked.\"  A poset is said to be (3+1)-free if it does not contain four vertices  a, b, c, d such that a < b < c and d is incomparable to the other three."
