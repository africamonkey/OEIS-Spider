        "There are binomial(n,11) ways to place the 11 black beads in the necklace with n beads. If n is not divisible by 11 there are no necklaces with a rotational symmetry. So exactly n necklaces are equivalent up to rotation and there are binomial(n,11)/n = ceiling(binomial(n,11)/n) equivalence classes.",
        "If n is divisible by 11 the only way to get a necklace with rotational symmetry is to space out the 11 black beads evenly. There are n/11 ways to do this and all ways are equivalent up to rotation. So there are  binomial(n,11) - n/11 unsymmetric necklaces which give binomial(n,11)/n - 1/11 equivalence classes. If we add the single symmetric equivalence class we get Binomial(n,11)/n - 1/11 + 1 which also is ceiling(binomial(n,11)/n). (End)",
