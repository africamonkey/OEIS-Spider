        "This sequence comes from an exercise proposed by Paul Erd\u0151s for Crux Mathematicorum (see link). In the solution, it's proved that for n >= 4, the fraction is always an integer for k = (n+1)! - 2. Be careful, n and k are swapped between Crux Mathematicorum and this sequence. A stronger statement is proposed in A290791.",
