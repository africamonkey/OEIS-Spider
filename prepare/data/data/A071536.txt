    "comment": [
        "Terms obtained, especially the 147, lend some support to the peculiar conjecture that the composition in any category can be extended to a total, associative operation, that is to a semigroup (not, of course, a monoid)."
    ],
    "example": [
        "For n=2, arrows 0:0->0, 1:1->1, f:0->1, g:1->0, the self-dual solution (commutes with reversing arrows) has multiplication table (rows and columns indexed by 0, 1, f, g in order) with rows: 0 f f 0; g 1 1 g; 0 f f 0; g 1 1 g."
