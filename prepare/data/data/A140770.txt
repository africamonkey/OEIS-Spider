    "comment": [
        "The rule is that the king can move in one step to any of the 26 (=3*3-1) adjacent positions; because we allow only solutions with n-1 steps, one component of the direction is enforced and only a choice of 9 different next steps remains; if the path is close to the cube surface, even fewer.",
        "This is the square of A081113, because for both x and y coordinates you have A081113(n) possibilities for the path (and you can choose them independently). - _Robert Gerbicz_, Jun 11 2010"

        "Example: for n=2, we can start from any of the 4 places on one face and move from there directly to any of the 4 positions on the opposite side: a(2) = 4*4 = 16."
