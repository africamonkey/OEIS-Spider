        "The negative numbers represented by x^2 + x*y - y^2 with relative prime x and y are -a(n).",
        "The discriminant of this binary form is D=5>0, hence this is an indefinite form.",
        "It appears that these are also the n for which the equation x^2 = x+1 (mod n) has solutions. The number of solutions is 0 or a power of 2. It appears that n=5 is the only n for which x^2 = x+1 (mod n) has just one solution. The first n producing 4 solutions is 209. The first n producing 8 solutions is 6061. - _T. D. Noe_, Nov 04 2009",
        "The terms are the products of primes congruent to {0,1,4} mod 5, which is A038872.",
        "Brousseau's paper lists these numbers (less than 1000) as discriminants of Fibonacci sequences. For each number, he also lists the (a,b) pairs that are the first two terms of a unique Fibonacci sequence.",
        "From _Matthew Staller_, Oct 01 2015: (Start)",
        "The number of solutions to n=|y^2-x^2-xy| with relatively prime x and y is 0 or 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of n that are congruent to {1,4} mod 5. For example, n=187891=11*19*29*31 has 16=2^4 solutions; the prime n=9999999929 has 2=2^1 solutions; n=84182245951=31^3*41^4 has 4=2^2 solutions.",
        "Recurring sequences (as Fibonacci sequences) may be ordered by determinant (|y^2-x^2-xy| for consecutive (x,y) terms), and further by individual terms to clarify where necessary. For example, the four distinct sequences that have a determinant of 209 are (13,8),(13,5),(14,13),(14,1) which shows how they were found but which would be more commonly understood as (8,21),(5,18),(13,27),(1,15). For a determinant of 1 there is exactly one sequence (Fibonacci, A000045), for a determinant of 5 there is just one (Lucas, A000032). For 11 there are two (1,4) and (2,5), the latter of which is known as the Evangelist sequence (A001060).",

        "The linear map (x,y) -> (5x+8y, 8x+13y) maps coprime integer solutions of x^2+xy-y^2 = n to coprime integer solutions, so if there is such a solution with nonnegative x,y there must be one with y < 8 sqrt(n). - _Robert Israel_, Oct 01 2015"
