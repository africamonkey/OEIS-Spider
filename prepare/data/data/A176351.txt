        "Consider the problem of finding the smallest number k such that the decimal representation of 1/k has period 3^e for a given e. The number k is usually 3^(e+2). However, if e is one of the n in this sequence, then the prime 2*3^n+1 is a smaller k. The first instance of these exceptions is 1/163, which has a period of 81.",
