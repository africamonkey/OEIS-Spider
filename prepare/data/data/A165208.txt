    "comment": [
        "The Bruhat graph on S_n is the directed graph with an edge connecting v to w whenever v and w differ by a transposition and w has more inversions than v. A maximal path in the Bruhat graph on S_n is one which goes from the identity element to the longest permutation [n,n-1,..., 2,1] written in one-line notation. Note, the Bruhat graph has more edges than the Hasse diagram for the Bruhat order. For example in S_3, [123] is connected to [321] in the Bruhat graph because they differ by a single transposition."
