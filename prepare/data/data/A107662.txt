    "comment": [
        "Let f(x) be any monic integral cubic polynomial with discriminant -n and irreducible over Z. Consider the set S of primes p such that f(x) has no zeros in Zp, i.e., f(x) is irreducible in Zp. For the discriminants -n in this sequence, set S coincides with the primes represented by one binary quadratic form ax^2+bxy+cy^2 with -n=b^2-4ac. For examples, see A106867, A106872, A106282, A106919, A106954, A106967, A040034 and A040038. This sequence consists of (1) terms 4d in A106312 such that the class number of d is 1, (2) terms d in A106312 such that the class number of d is 3 and (3) 108 and 243."
