        "We define a transformation T_f [b(n)] = [c(n)] - the index f means \"forming\" - of an increasing sequence b(n) of integers b(1), b(2), b(3), \u2026, b(k) which produces an increasing sequence c(n) of the same length, c(1), c(2), c(3), \u2026, c(k) such that c(1) = b(1), and for j>1, c(j) is the only integer b(j-1) < c(j) <= b(j), with (b(j)-b(j-1)) | c(j). We say b(n) is forming c(n).",
        "An increasing sequence c(n) is called formed from the increasing sequence b(n) by T_f [b(n)] when there is an increasing sequence b(n) such that b(1) = c(1), for j>1, b(j) is an integer c(j) <= b(j) < c(j+1) such that difference b(j) - b(j-1) divides c(j).",
        "This transformation T_invf [c(n)] is an inverse of T_f [b(n)], but this inversion of c(n) back to b(n) may not be unique, and there are also increasing sequences c(n) which do not have an image T_invf [c(n)]. We call the latter sequences c(n) \"unformed.\"",
        "Each increasing sequences b(n) can be transform by transformation T_f [b(n)] but this does not apply to transformation T_invf [b(n)]. An increasing sequence c(n) is called totally formed if c(n) = T_f [c(n)] = T_invf [c(n)]. Each totally formed sequence is formed.",
