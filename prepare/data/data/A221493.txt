        "A bicolored graph on n labelled vertices, k of which are black, and (n-k) of which are white, can be represented as a k by (n-k) matrix, where the (i,j) entry is 1 if the i-th black vertex is adjacent to the j-th white vertex, and 0 otherwise. Then, the graph is tangled if (1) the matrix does not have any rows or columns of all 0s or all 1s; and (2) it is not possible to permute the rows of the matrix and the columns of the matrix to obtain a matrix of the form",
