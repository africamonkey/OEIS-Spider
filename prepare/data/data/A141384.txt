        "The fourth-order linear recurrence established by _Max Alekseyev_ for A141221, based on the minimal polynomial of the above (singular) matrix, namely x(x-1)(x^3-7x^2+9x-1) = x^5-8*x^4+16*x^3-10*x^2+x. Since its degree is 5, the corresponding recurrence holds for corresponding elements of the successive powers (or sums thereof, including matrix traces) only for n>=5. The recurrence would be valid down to n=4 if we had a(0)=4, which is not the case."
