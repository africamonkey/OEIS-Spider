        "This sequence comes from a small change of an exercise proposed by Paul Erd\u0151s for Crux Mathematicorum (see link). In the solution, they show that for n >= 3, the fraction is always an integer for k = (n+1)! - 2. Be careful, n and k are swapped between Crux Mathematicorum and this sequence."
