        "Equivalently, either (1+i)^n + i times its conjugate is an ordinary prime, or n == 2 (mod 4) and 2^(n/2) + (-1)^((n-2)/4) is an ordinary prime.",
        "Let z = (1+i)^n + i. If z is not pure real or pure imaginary, then z is a Gaussian prime if the product of z and its conjugate is a rational prime. That product is 1 + 2^n + sin(n*Pi/4)*2^(1+n/2). z is imaginary when n=4k+2, in which case, z has magnitude 2^(2k+1) + (-1)^k. These pure imaginary numbers are Gaussian primes when 2^(2k+1)-1 is a Mersenne prime and 2k+1 = 1 (mod 4); that is, when n is twice an odd number in A112633. - T. D. Noe, Mar 07 2011"
