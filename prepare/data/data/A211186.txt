        "\"Smallest\" means lexicographically (1 < 2 < 10 < ...) first.",
        "From a(2)=2 on, there may not occur any other term with the digit 1. From a(3)=4 on, the digits 2 and 3 are excluded. From a(4)=7 on, the digits 5 and 6 are excluded. From a(5)=44 on, the digit 0 is also excluded, and subsequent terms are all larger numbers made from digits 4,7,8 or 9; one can check that then no further contradictions can appear.",
        "Thus there are 4^d terms with d digits, for d=1,2,3,... This leads to an explicit formula for the n-th term."
