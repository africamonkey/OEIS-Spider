        "Lambda is the function in A002322. If there are infinitely many Sophie Germain  primes (conjecture), then this sequence is infinite. Proof: The numbers of the form 3p^2 are in a subsequence if p and 2p+1 are both prime with p > 3, because from the property that lambda(3p^2) = p(p-1) and lambda (p(2p+1)) = p(p-1),  if m = 3p^2 then lambda(m-phi(m)) = lambda (3p^2 - p(p-1)) = lambda(p(2p+1)) = p(p-1) = lambda(m)."
