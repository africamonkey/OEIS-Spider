        "These primes are a subset of the non-harmonic primes A092102. Because these primes are analogous to the irregular primes A000928 that divide the numerators of Bernoulli numbers, they might be called H-irregular primes. The density of these primes is about 0.4 -- very close to the density of irregular primes.",
        "These primes are called Harmonic irregular primes in the Wikipedia entry for \"Regular prime\" (see links). It may be noted that if p is known to be of this type and H(k) is the smallest Harmonic number divisible by p, then not only does k < p-1 hold, but k <= (p-1)/2. This is because, by symmetry, H(p-1-n) == H(n) (mod p), so that any eligible k lying between (p+1)/2 and p-1 would have a counterpart in the range between 1 and (p-1)/2. Furthermore, the minimal k cannot be exactly equal to (p-1)/2, because then p would be a Wieferich prime (A001220) and would also divide H(Int(p/4)). Thus k <= (p-3)/2, and this inequality is sharp because exact equality holds for p = 29, 37, 3373 (see A072984). - _John Blythe Dobson_, Apr 09 2015"
