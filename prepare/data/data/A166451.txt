        "Both sets of 5 numbers have the same sum of 6 cubed = 216; and both sets can be extended to produce a summation of 8 cubed = 512. I wish I could use a whole page to describe all the weird stuff I know about this/these set(s): for example: 34-11=23, 35-16=19, 45-25=20, 46-41=5, and 123-56=67, which is interesting partly because 23+19+20+5=67. The entire collection of relations I know of is much more interesting than just this."
