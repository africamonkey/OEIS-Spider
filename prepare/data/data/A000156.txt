        "The Carlitz paper has the wrong formula on p. 505, eq. (3). The factor in front of tau(n/2) should be -2^16 (not -2^12). The mistake appeared in the previous equation derived from eq. (2) where theta_3^(24) * 256*k^4*k'^4 was replaced by 2^8*g(q^2) which produces the factor 2^8*256 = 2^16. (One should subtract on  p. 504 the second equation in the middle from the negative of the first equation. There is also a sign mistake in the sum term of the third equation from the bottom.)  - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 24 2016"
