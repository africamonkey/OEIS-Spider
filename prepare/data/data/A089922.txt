        "These numbers are rare. For the case of the reverse concatenation of the consecutive numbers 1,2,3,... I have only found 828180...54321. Certainly, we can reduce the trials by noting that 2/3 of the numbers formed this way are multiples of 3 for the consecutive numbers and 1/3 of the odd consecutive numbers is a multiple of 3 but I do not think that will help much using PARI.",
