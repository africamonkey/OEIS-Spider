        "Subsequence of A025296. But sequences A025315 and A025296 are different. 2*5^8 = 781250 = 625^2 + 625^2 (not distinct squares) = 425^2 + 775^2 = 365^2 + 805^2 = 191^2 + 863^2 = 125^2 + 875^2 is not in A025315. - _Vaclav Kotesovec_, Feb 27 2016",
        "Numbers in A025296 but not in A025315 are exactly those numbers of the form 2*p_1^(2*a_1)*p_2^(2*a_2)*...*p_m^(2*a_m)*q_1^8 or of the form 2*p_1^(2*a_1)*p_2^(2*a_2)*...*p_m^(2*a_m)*q_1^2*q_2^2 where p_i are primes of the form 4k+3 and q_1, q_2 are distinct primes of the form 4k+1.  Thus 2*5^2*13^2 = 8450 is the smallest term in A025296 that is not in A025315. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Feb 27 2016"
