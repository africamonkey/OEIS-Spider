    "comment": [
        "This sequence gives two alternative ways to encode rooted plane binary trees (Stanley's interpretation 'c' = interpretation 'd' without the outermost edges):",
        "A: scan each term from left to right and for each 0, add a leaf node to the tree (terminate a branch), for each 1, add a leftward leaning branch \\, for each 2, add a rightward leaning branch / and for each 3, add a double-branch \\/ and continue in left-to-right, depth-first fashion.",
        "B: Like method A, but the roles of digits 1 and 2 are swapped. When one compares the generated trees to the \"standard order\" as specified in the illustrations for A014486, one obtains the permutation A074684/A074683 for the case A and A082356/A082355 for the case B.",
        "If we assign the following weights for each digit: w(0) = -1, w(1) = w(2) = 0, w(3) = +1, then the sequence gives all base-4 numbers for which all the partial sums of digit weights (from the most significant to the least significant end) are nonnegative and the final sum is zero. The initial term 0 is considered to have no significant digits at all, so its total weight is zero also."
