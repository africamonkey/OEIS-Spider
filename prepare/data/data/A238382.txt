        "A pair of numbers x and y is called an untouchable amicable pair if x and y are amicable numbers (see A063990) and if x and y each have only one aliquot antecedent: the other number of their pair. In other words, they are amicable pairs which no aliquot sequence starting on a number that does not belong to this pair can reach.",
