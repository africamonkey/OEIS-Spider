        "Minimum number of diagonals among simple convex polyhedra having n faces is obtained from a polyhedron with two triangular faces, n-4 quadrangular faces and two (n-1)-sided faces. A polyhedron having 3 triangular faces, 3 pentagonal faces and 1 hexagonal face gives another example of a simple convex polyhedron with the least possible number of diagonals for n = 7. A polyhedron having 4 triangular faces and 4 hexagonal faces gives a similar example for n = 8.",
