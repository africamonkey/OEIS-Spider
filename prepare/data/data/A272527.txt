        "The numbers prime(k)- 2 are a subsequence of A173960 (averages of four consecutive odd squares, or numbers of form 4*m^2+8*m+9), and also subsequence of A040976 (numbers prime(n) - 2). So, a(n) are the indices k such prime(k) are of the form  4*m^2+8*m+11 with the corresponding m = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 25, 28,...}.",
        "The sequence A173960 and the subsequence prime(a(n)) - 2 appear in a diagonal straight line in the Ulam spiral (see the illustration)."
