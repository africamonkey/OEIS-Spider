        "First apply A003961(n), where the primes in the prime factorization of natural number n are shifted one step left [i.e. each p_i changes to p_{i+1}]. Then increment the resulting odd number by one to get an even number, which is divided by 2, and the same three operations are done second time to that quotient. This sequence consists of such numbers for which the final result is equal to the original n which we started from.",

Shifting this once left results p_17 = 59, and (59+1)/2 = 30 again. Thus 30 is included in the sequence. For the same reason 53 is also included in the sequence."
