        "Original name: Sequence of unique powers from a quaternion generalization of Gaussian quadratic reciprocity (quaternion quartic reciprocity).",
        "The quaternion[ -1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 1/2] is equivalent here to the Gaussian (-1). I've eliminated all the powers that give the identity matrix. These matrices are all unitary (determinant one). When the matrices of these unique powers are sorted they only make 9 types in the first 10^4 products. [This comment needs to be clarified]",
        "This quaternion is a primitive cube root of 1; its powers behave like any other primitive cube root of 1. We are thus looking at products (p+1)*(q+1)*(r+1)*(s+1) modulo 48, where p, q, r, and s are primes. The only possible odd result is with all 4 primes = 2: 81. If no prime = 2, the result must be a multiple of 16, which gives three residues, one of which is the identity. If 2 and another prime are present, the result is a multiple of 6, which produces 8 residues; again, one is the identity. - Franklin T. Adams-Watters, Aug 20 2011"
