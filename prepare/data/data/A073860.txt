        "The sequence is complete. Proof: We must find a prime p and an integer x such that p = x^6 - (2+7+503+1889+30367) = x^6 - 32768 = (x^2-32)*(x^4+32*x^2+1024). Since p is prime, we must have p=1*p, therefore we can only have x=sqrt(33) to make p = (1)*(3169). However, sqrt(33) is not an integer. Therefore we can conclude that there is no prime p satisfying the equation. - Francois Jooste (pin(AT)myway.com), Mar 09 2003"
