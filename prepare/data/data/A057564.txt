    "comment": [
        "Called \"Beastly neighbors\" because 666 is the least element of the sequence and because these numbers are seen to have a symmetric relationship with their two \"neighbors,\" using analogy to numbering houses on the same side of the street (e.g. 664 and 668 are \"neighbors\" of 666)."

        "Phi[Sigma[666]]=Phi[1482]=432=2*216=2*Phi[666], Sigma[664]=1260=2*630=2*Sigma[328]=Sigma[Phi[664]], Sigma[668]=1176=2*588=2*Sigma[332]=Sigma[Phi[668]]. Thus 666 is an element of the sequence."
