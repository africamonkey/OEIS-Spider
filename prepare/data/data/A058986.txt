        "\"The chef in our place is sloppy and when he prepares a stack of pancakes they come out all different sizes. Therefore when I deliver them to a customer, on the way to the table I rearrange them (so that the smallest winds up on top and so on, down to the largest at the bottom) by grabbing several from the top and flipping them over, repeating this (varying the number I flip) as many times as necessary. If there are n pancakes, what is the maximum number of flips (as a function a(n) of n) that I will ever have to use to rearrange them?\" [Dweighter]",
        "J. K. McLean (jkmclean(AT)webone.com.au): If the worst case for n pancakes is x flips, then the worst case for n + 1 pancakes can be no greater than x + 2 flips. Getting the n + 1 pancake to the bottom of the pile will require 0, 1 or 2 flips, after which you can sort the n remaining pancakes in at most x flips.",
        "Comments based on email message from Brian Hayes, Oct 10 2007: (Start)",
        "We are interested in the diameter of the graph where the vertices are all possible permutations of n elements and an edge connects p(i) and p(j) if some allowed reversal transforms p(i) into p(j).",
        "There are at least two dimensions to consider in describing the various sorting-by-reversal problems: (a), Are the elements of the sequence signed or unsigned? and (b), Are we constrained to work only from one end of the sequence?",
        "The standard pancake problem has unsigned elements and allows moves only from the top of the stack; the diameter is given by the present sequence.",
        "The \"burnt-pancake\" problem has signed elements and allows moves only from the top of the stack. This is sequence A078941 (and also A078942).",
        "The biologically-inspired sorting problems I was writing about in the Amer. Scientist 2007 column dispense with the one-end-only constraint. You're allowed to reverse any segment of contiguous elements, anywhere in the permutation. For the unsigned case, a(n) = n-1 (cf. Kececioglu and Sankoff).",
        "Finally there is the signed case without the one-end constraint. This was the main subject of my column and corresponds to sequence A131209. (End)",

However, Gates and Papadimitrou establish a lower bound on the pancake sequence of at least 17n / 16. For sufficiently large n, this is always larger than the triangle.",
