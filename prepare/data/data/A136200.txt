        "Similar to A136197, A136198, A136199. For s(1) from 1 to 10000 the only achieved situations were: (a) like A136139, it ends in the 16-cycle (15, 23, 33, 85, 76, 130, 41, 105, 265, 35, 19, 13, 16, 12, 61, 25); (b) it ends in the 4-cycle (28, 50, 251, 163); (c) it ends in the 3-cycle (22, 40, 70). No fixed points were found in this case."
