    "comment": [
        "Use (American if different) English. Names of these numbers then exhibit alliteration (as in poetry or literature), hence the suggested name. Hyphens connecting words and any use of the word \"and\" is ignored. If, for example, the normal \"American System\" (short scale with no \"milliard\", \"billiard\", etc.) with the suggested extension by reusable prefixes as developed and described by L.C. Noll (see link) is then used, this sequence is both well-defined and infinite."

        "22 is the first term because its English name, the compound word \"twenty-two\", is considered here to be two words and each word starts with the letter \"t\". 1555 is not a term because it is treated here as \"one thousand five hundred fifty five\", not \"fifteen fifty five\" as, for example, the year 1555 would be called."
