        "The value a(n) also gives the number of non-crossing partitions on [n] such that (a) each block of the partition is a non-crossing partition itself (recursively) and (b) every partition in this recursion contains at least one singleton block (see A000108). Omitting the factor n in the equation for a(n) gives A110447."
