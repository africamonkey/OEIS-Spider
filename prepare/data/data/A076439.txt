    "name": "Numbers n which appear to have a unique representation as the difference of two perfect powers and those powers are both 2; that is, there is only one solution to Pillai's equation a^x - b^y = n, with a>0, b>0, x>1, y>1 and that solution has x=y=2.",
    "comment": [
        "There are two types of unique solutions. See A076438 for the general case. The n for which the unique solution can be written as n = a^2 - b^2 seems to have the following properties: (1) b = a-1 for odd n and b = a-2 for even n and (2) n = 4^r p^s, where r is in {0,1}, p is an odd prime and s is in {1,2). This sequence was found by examining all perfect powers (A001597) less than 2^63-1. By examining a larger set of perfect powers, we may discover that some of these numbers do not have a unique representation."
