        "There are n cities located on the vertices of a convex n-gon and 2 types of communication lines available. Any city can be connected to any other by only one communication line (that can be of any type). A network exists if at least 2 cities are connected by a communication line. The sequence shows how many different networks a(n) can be built. In general, if the number of communication-line types is c, then a(n) = (c+1)^(n(n+1)/2)-1. Thus other sequences of this type can be generated."
