    "comment": [
        "Consider a fragmentation process of an n-object which consists of n unlabeled elements (= 1-parts). By definition the n-object can scatter into up to n m-parts where an m-part consists of 1 up to n elements. A 4-object can split up for example into 4 1-parts which corresponds to the integer partition [1,1,1,1], or it can, for example, rest unfragmented which corresponds to [4]. Since the number of integer partitions of n=4 equals 5, there are 5 n=4-fragmentation processes.",
        "Now we ask for the probability of getting an m-part after an n-fragmentation. Think of a Greek statue which had been broken into n parts and covered by earth. We could find several m-parts, in the most lucky case we would find all m-parts which add up to m_1+m_2+...+m_n=n. Then the statue could be restored.",
        "For example for n=4 we could ask for the probability prob(n=4,m=2) of just a single 2-part. We have 2 cases for a 2-part and we have 15 cases in total, thus prob(n=4,m=2)=2/15 (the 2 cases come from [1,1,2] and [2,2]). The chances to find the two 2-parts from the [2,2]-fragmentation are 1/15 only. The chances to find the n=4-object unsplitted are also 1/15 only.",
        "This sequence is generated over the unordered partitions; for example, when n = 4 there are 1+3+2+5+4 = 15 cases. If we allow a null case for each of the five partitions then we have 15+5 = 20 which is A000712(4). - _Alford Arnold_, Dec 12 2006",
