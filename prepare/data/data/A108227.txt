    "comment": [
        "If we replace \"abundant\" in the definition with \"non-deficient\", we get the same sequence with an initial 2 instead of 3, barring an astronomically unlikely coincidence with some as-yet-undiscovered odd perfect number. [This is sequence A107705. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 14 2017]",
        "It appears that all terms >= 5 correspond to the odd primitive abundant numbers (A006038) which are products of consecutive primes (cf. A285993), i.e., of the form N = Product_{0<=i<r} prime(n+i) for some r, which turns out to be r = a(n). - _M. F. Hasler_, May 08 2017"
