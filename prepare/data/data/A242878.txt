    "comment": [
        "CAVEAT: Up to 10^5, the length of the 3-tower is unknown for the following discriminants: 17131, 21668, 24884, 28279, 34027, 35539, 64952, 65203, 72591, 92660, 92827. The performance of the MAGMA script in section PROG would be much slower, if the class number of the first Hilbert 3-class field were computed. This would admit a criterion for the exclusion of the mentioned exceptional discriminants. Therefore, including the superfluous brushwood was the lesser of two evils."
