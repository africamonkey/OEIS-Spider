        "Formerly called colossally deficient numbers, but this is not a good name.",
        "This sequence includes, but is not limited to, all prime numbers and powers of prime numbers. The only even numbers in this sequence are the powers of 2. The first odd number not in this sequence is 105. 105 is deficient but 105^2 (11025) is not. The first deficient number not in this sequence is 10.",
        "Laatsch shows that if a number n has prime factors p1, p2,..., then the least upper bound of the sequence sigma(n^k)/n^k is p1/(p1-1) p2/(p2-1)... This equals n/phi(n), where phi is Euler's totient function. Hence n is in this sequence if 2 phi(n) >= n, which is the complement of A054741. - _T. D. Noe_, May 08 2006"
