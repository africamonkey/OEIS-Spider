        "The transform takes the original sequence s(0), s(1), s(2),.. and fills the 0th column of a lower triangular array with t(r,0) = s(r). The remaining columns of the triangular array are filled by a sum over the left neighbor plus two entries of the previous row: t(r,c) = t(r,c-1) +t(r-1,r-c) +t(r-1,r-c-1), 1<=c<=r. [The last term in this sum does not exist if r=c and is implicitly defined as t(r-1,-1)=0 then.] The result of the transform is the sequence of numbers t(r,r) along the diagonal of the triangular array for r>=0. - _R.
