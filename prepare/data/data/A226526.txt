        "The semiprime analogous to A181503.",
        "Because the semiprimes are sparser than the primes in the beginning, the sequence contains more of the lesser semiprimes than the analogous sequence of primes. In fact, one has to get to the seventeenth semiprime before it, 49,is not present, whereas in A181503, one only has to get to the sixth prime before it, 13, is not present.",
