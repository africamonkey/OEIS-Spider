    "comment": [
        "Here \"graded\" means that there exists a rank function rk from the poset to the integers such that whenever v covers w in the poset, we have rk(v) = rk(w) + 1. Note that this notion of grading is weaker than in sequence A006860, which counts posets in which all maximal chains have the same length."
