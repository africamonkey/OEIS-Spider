        "There are many examples of 4 consecutive numbers having decreasing values of sigma (see cross references) and there are 83 cases of 6 consecutive numbers with decreasing values of sigma < 4,293,000,000. Interestingly (and for unknown reasons) there are no examples of exactly 5 such consecutive numbers in that range! All known members of the sequence are multiples of 6 and one less than a multiple of 35."
