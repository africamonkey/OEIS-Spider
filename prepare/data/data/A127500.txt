    "comment": [
        "Shortest means the minimum number of moves, where a move is one or more jumps by the same peg. The reference calculates a(n) up to n=10 and gives the bounds 19<=a(11)<=28, 21<=a(12)<=29, as well as an upper bound for n a multiple of 12. A trivial upper bound is a(n)<=T(n)-2, where T(n) is the n-th triangular number."
