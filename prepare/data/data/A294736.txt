        "This sequence is complete, see the von Eitzen Link and Price's computation that the next term must be > 50000. Proof. The link mentions \"for positive integer n, if n > 5408 then the number of ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares is at least Floor(Sqrt(n - 101) / 8)\". So for n > 5408, there are more than two ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares. For n <= 5408, it has been verified if n is in the sequence by inspection. Hence the sequence is complete.\" - _David A. Corneth_, Nov 08 2017"
