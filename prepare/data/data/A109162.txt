        "After the initial 1, even-indexed terms are of the form 4k+2 (members of A016825) and odd-indexed terms are of the form 6k+3 (members of A016945). However, not all even terms after 2 are multiples of three, because not all odd-indexed terms are of the form 4k+3. For example, because a(11) is of the form 4k+1, a(12) cannot be a multiple of three. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jun 18 2017"
