        "If n=10^s*m is a term of the sequence where s>0 and gcd(m,10)=1, then for each positive integer k, 10^k*m is in the sequence. Because sum of the digits of 10^k*n  equals to sum of the digits of n and sum of the distinct prime factors of 10^k*n equals to sum of the distinct prime factors of n. Also it is obvious that m isn't in the sequence. [_Jahangeer Kholdi_, Oct 07 2013]"
