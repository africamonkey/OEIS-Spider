        "Decree that (row 1) = (1) and (row 2) = (3,2).  For n >= 4, row n consists of numbers in decreasing order generated as follows:  x+1 for each x in row n-1 together with 3/x for each x in row n-1, and duplicates are rejected as they occur.  Then a(n) = (number of numbers in row n); it appears that this sequence is not linearly recurrent."
