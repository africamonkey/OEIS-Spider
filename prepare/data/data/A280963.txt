    "comment": [
        "This sequence is similar to A140110. Both sequences concern numbers such that consecutive divisors of these numbers have a ratio which is of the form (k+1)/k for A140110 and (k+2)/k for this sequence.",
        "So for each q >= 1, one can define a corresponding sequence where the said ratio is of the form (k+q)/k. It appears that such sequences are reduced to a single term 1 when q+1 is not prime. On the other hand when p=q-1 is prime (see A006093), then these sequences include the terms 1, p, p^2, .... so they are infinite.",
        "The sequence of powers of 3 (A000244) is a subsequence. And all terms except 1 are divisible by p, here 3."
