        "A V-toothpick is constructed from two toothpicks of length 1 with a 120-degree angle between them, forming a V.",
        "On the infinite hexagonal grid, we start at round 0 with no V-toothpicks.",
        "At round 1 we place a V-toothpick anywhere in the plane.",
        "At round 2 we place two other V-toothpicks. Note that, after round 2, in the structure there are three V-toothpicks, with seven 120-degree angles and one 240-degree angle.",
        "At round 3 we place four other V-toothpicks.",
        "And so on...",
        "The structure looks like an unfinished honeycomb.",
        "The sequence gives the number of V-toothpicks after n rounds. A161207 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.",
        "See the entry A139250 for more information about the growth of toothpicks.",
        "Note that, on the infinite hexagonal grid, a V-toothpick can be represented as a polyedge with two components. In this case, at n-th round, the structure is a polyedge with 2*a(n) components (or 2*a(n) toothpicks).",
        "In the structure we can see distinct closed polygonal regions with side length equal to 1, for example: regular hexagons, concave decagons, concave dodecagons."
