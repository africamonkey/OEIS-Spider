        "The indices of this sequence, Beaufort Numbers 0 through 12, originally (in 1805) represented different categories of wind force and their effects on a \"well-conditioned man-of-war\" (Admiral Beaufort's type of ship). Only later were specific ranges of wind speeds attached to the force numbers. The World Meteorological Organization has associated a brief descriptive name to each Beaufort Number (see NWS link); for example, 0=Calm, 8=Gale, 10=Storm, 12=Hurricane. The Met Office link indicates that this scale was extended in 1944 to Beaufort Number 17 and 118 knots; 13 through 17 are only intended to be used for special circumstances such as tropical cyclones. The extension limits the definition of Force 12 to no more than 71 knots. (Most sources I've seen list only Beaufort Numbers 0 through 12 so I'm attaching keyword \"full\" here.)"
