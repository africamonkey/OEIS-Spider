        "For a generalized Lucas sequence U(n) = (a^n-b^n)/(a-b), where a + b and ab are nonzero coprime integers and (a/b) is not a root of unity, a prime factor of the n-th term of some Lucas sequence U(n) is called primitive if it does not divide U(r) for any r < n.",
        "Let P = a + b > 0, Q = ab and D = P^2 - 4Q = (a-b)^2. In the case a, b are real (equivalently, D > 0), Carmichael shows that, if n <> 1, 2, 6, then U(n) has at least one primitive prime factor not dividing D except U(3) ((P, Q, D)=(1, -2, 9), (1, -1, 5)), U(5) ((P, Q, D)=(1, -1, 5)) and U(12) ((P, Q, D)=(1, -1, 5)).",
