        "A few years ago, challenges had been launched to find a prime power p^n, n>1 as large as possible, cf. links. I have remarked that it is easy to find arbitrarily large examples by taking the square of very large primes, rather than high powers of smaller primes, and suggested a merit function to take into account and penalize such \"trivial\" solutions. This led to a new challenge including the condition n > p. This sequence lists such numbers with the last condition relaxed to n >= p, which is sufficient to make the search nontrivial but includes a few more terms, namely the zeroless powers p^p (A051674 intersect A052382).",
        "Possibly is a(80) = 19^44 the largest term; there are no greater ones in the first 500000 terms of A257278. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, May 01 2015"
