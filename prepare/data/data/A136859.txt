        "Are the formulas conjectured or proved? For example, the analogous sequence for {0,1,2,4} contains the sporadic solution 1010000104010000101. Clearly, if a(n) is in the sequence then 10*a(n) is also in the sequence. Is there any term that is not 0, 1, or 4 times a power of 10? - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 26 2016",
