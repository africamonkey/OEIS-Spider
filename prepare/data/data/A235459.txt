        "The correlation polytope of degree n is the set of symmetric n X n matrices, P such that P[i,j] = Prob(X[i] = 1 and X[j] = 1) where (X[1],...,X[n]) is a sequence of 0/1 valued random variables (not necessarily independent). It is the convex hull of all n X n symmetric 0/1 matrices of rank 1.",
        "The correlation polytope COR(n) is affinely equivalent to CUT(n+1), where CUT(n) is the cut polytope of complete graph on n vertices -- the convex hull of indicator vectors of a cut delta(S) -- where S is a subset of the vertices. The cut delta(S) is the set of edges with one end point in S and one endpoint not in S.",
        "According to the SMAPO database it is conjectured that",
        "a(8) = 12,246,651,158,320. This database also says that the above value of a(7) is conjectural, but Ziegler lists it as known."
