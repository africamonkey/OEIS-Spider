        "A digit count numerically summarizes the frequency of digits 0 through 9 in that order when they occur in a number.",
        "This uses a different method from A108810. Here the digits are described in increasing order, whereas in A108810 they can be described in any order.",
        "This sequence is finite, since T(x) < x for every x with at least 22 digits. Last term is a(109) = 101112213141516171819. - Schimke",
