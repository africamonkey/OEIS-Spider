        "Mike Keith's website uses a shorthand notation for these numbers. The 4-primeval prime 100111222333444555666777998889 is written in this notation as (1) 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 998889. The (1) represents the leading 1 digit (which will always be present). The next number says how many consecutive 0's follow the leading 1 and the next says how many consecutive 1's follow that and so on up to the number of consecutive 8's. The final grouping explicitly shows how the last group of 8's and 9's are arranged.",
