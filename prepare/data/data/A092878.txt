    "comment": [
        "Class n, for n>0, contains all numbers k such that n iterations of the Euler phi function applied to k yields 2; class 0 contains only the numbers 1 and 2. There is a conjecture that the smallest number in class n is always odd. This increasing sequence supports that conjecture. As shown by Shapiro, all the initial odd numbers in class n>0 are between 2^n and 2^(n+1)."
