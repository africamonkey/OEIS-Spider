        "It appears that this list refers to analog (VHF?) channels before the 2011 switch to digital; as of 2016 the channels appear to be 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Anyone knowing the dates which these channels were used is encouraged to add that information to this sequence. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 06 2016"
