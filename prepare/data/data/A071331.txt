        "Luca & Stanica show that this sequence contains infinitely many Fibonacci numbers. In particular, there is some N such that for all n > N, Fibonacci(1807873 + 3543120*n) is in this sequence. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 06 2011",
        "Chen shows that there are five consecutive odd numbers M-8, M-6, M-4, M-2, M, for which all are members of the sequence.  Such M may be large; Chen shows that it is less than 2^(2^253000).  In fact, there exists an arithmetic progression of such M, and thus they have positive density. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 06 2011"
