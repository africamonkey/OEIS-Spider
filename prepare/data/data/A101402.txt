        "Either a(n) = a(n-1) or a(n) = a(n-1) + 1. Proof: Suppose n is a power of 2, then a(n+1) = a(n) + a(0) = a(n). Otherwise let 2m be the largest power of 2 greater than n, so a(n) = a(m) + a(n-1-m) and a(n+1) = a(m) + a(n-m) and then proceed by induction. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Aug 27 2014",
        "It appears that this sequence gives the partial sums of A164349. - _Arie Groeneveld_, Aug 27 2014",
        "Each term other than zero appears at least twice. Suppose m is a power of 2, then a(2m) and a(4m) appear at least twice by my above comment. Otherwise suppose 3 <= k+2 <= 2m, then a(2m+k) = a(m) + a(m+k-1), a(2m+k+1) = a(m) + a(2m+k), and a(2m+k+2) = a(m) + a(m) + a(m+k+1), so a(2m+k+2) - a(2m+k) = a(m+k+1) - a(m+k-1). So if each term from a(m) to a(2m) appears at least twice then so will each term in a(2m) to a(4m). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 10 2014",
