    "comment": [
        "If making a statistical bar chart with x-axis denoting the number of decompositions of an even number, and y-axis denoting the number of hits of an x-axis value for all 3 <= k <= m, there are one or more commonest x value presenting with highest y value.  Such commonest x values increase when m increases, and fall on the x values listed in this sequence.",
        "Hypothesis: With the increase of m, the commonest number of decompositions of 2n into an unordered sum of two odd primes in the range of 3 <= k <= m ascends.",
        "This hypothesis derives that the corresponding smallest m to the terms of this sequence makes an ascending sequence.  Or say, when testing with m ascending, once a number a(n) enters this sequence, no number smaller than a(n) will be able to enter this sequence if they had not enter previous."
