        "The same sequence (0,0,1,3,9,21,49,...) turns up when you start with an isosceles right triangular piece of paper and repeatedly fold it in half, snipping corners as you go. Is there an easy way to see why the two questions have the same answer? - _James Propp_, Jul 05 2016",

        "This case seems a little more complicated than the rectangular case, since with the triangle you alternate between horizontal/vertical folds vs. diagonal folds, and the resulting fold pattern is more complex, but I think the basic argument is essentially the same.",
        "Note that with the triangle, the first hole doesn't appear until after you've made 3 folds, so if you start counting at zero folds, you have three leading zeros in the sequence:  0,0,0,1,3,9,21,... (End)"
