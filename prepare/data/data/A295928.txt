    "comment": [
        "A triple {T(n,i,k), T(n,i,k+1), T(n,i-1,k)} will be called a primitive triangle. It is easy to see that b(n) = n(n-1)/2 is the number of such triangles. At each step, exactly one primitive triangle is completed (replaced by {1, 1, 1}). So there are b(n) \"0\"- and n \"1\"-terms. Thus the starting matrix has no complete primitive triangle. Furthermore, any triangular submatrix T(m,i,k), k <= i <= m < n cannot have more than m \"1\"-terms because otherwise it would have less \"0\"-terms than primitive triangles. The replacement of at least one \"0\"-term would complete more than one primitive triangle. This has been excluded.",
        "So T(n, i, k) is a special case of U(n, i, k), described in A101481: a(n) < A101481(n+1).",
        "A start matrix may serve as a pattern for a number wall used on worksheets for elementary mathematics, see link \"Number walls\". That is why I prefer the more descriptive name \"fill matrix\".",
        "The algorithm for the sequence is rather slow because each start matrix is constructed separately. There exists a faster recursive algorithm which produces the same terms and therefore is likely to be correct, but it is based on a conjecture.
