        "We say there is a \"hit\" in factorial base representation (A007623) of n when there is any such pair of nonzero digits d_i and d_j in positions i > j so that (i - d_i) = j. Here the rightmost (least significant digit) occurs at position 1. This sequence gives all \"hit-free\" numbers, meaning that for every nonzero digit d_i (in position i) in their factorial base representation the digit at the position (i - d_i) is 0.",
