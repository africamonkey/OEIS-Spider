    "comment": [
        "A periodic infinite word consists of a block x repeated infinitely to the right:  X = x^omega = xxx.... The minimal period length of such a word X is the length of the shortest word y such that X = y^omega. Such a word has the constant-gap property if for each letter i occurring in the word, there is a constant c_i such that two consecutive occurrences of i are separated by exactly c_i symbols. For example (0102)^omega is a constant-gap word on 3 symbols with minimal period length 4.",
        "Alternatively, this is the number of distinct lcm's of moduli that can appear in a disjoint covering system of the integers consisting of n congruences. Disjoint covering systems and constant-gap periodic sequences are in 1-1 correspondence. For example, the covering system corresponding to (0102)^omega is x == 0 (mod 2), x == 1 (mod 4), x == 3 (mod 4), and the lcm of the moduli (2,4,4) is 4."
