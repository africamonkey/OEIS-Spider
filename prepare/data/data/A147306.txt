    "comment": [
        "In a variant of the ABC conjecture (see A120498) we look at triples (A,B,C) restricted to A+B=C, gcd(A,B)=1, and at the merit function L(A,B,C)=log(C)/log(rad(A*B*C)), where rad() is the squarefree kernel A007947, as usual. Watching for records in L() as C runs through the integers generates A147302. In this sequence here, we admit only the C of the sequence A033845, which avoids some early larger records that would be created by unrestricted C, and leads to a slower increase of the L-values.",
        "If the ABC conjecture is true this sequence is finite.",
        "The associated numbers B for this case are A147305, the associated A are A147307."

        "(A,B,C) = (1,17,18) reaches L=0.6249.. The first C-number selected from A033845 that does not generate a new record is 72."
