        "The female population of Rabbits is; a(n)= f[n]-Floor[f[n]/2] Here that is the term: f[n - 2] - Floor[f[n - 2]/2] One natural child birth population limit is death by infection of the mothers. The fourth generation death of old age is the Floor[f[n - 4]/2] term. The resulting sequence approaches a stable population of rabbits at ratio one.",
