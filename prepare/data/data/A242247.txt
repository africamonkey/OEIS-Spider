    "comment": [
        "A restriction a(n)<=n^2+1 allows one to make the sequence computable for n>=1 and, at the same time, to somewhat agree with heuristic arguments for large n.",
        "The sequence is based on a conjecture stronger than Goldbach's Conjecture: for arbitrary large N there exists m(N), such that for k>m(N), the number of unordered Goldbach representations (A002375) of 2*k is more than N.",
        "From heuristic arguments, it follows that m(N) ~ N*log^2(2*N). Then, conjecturally, for n>=3, a(n) < n*log^2(2*n).",
        "The existence of a(n) for arbitrary n says that, if to remove from the sequence of primes an arbitrary large M of the first terms, the Goldbach representations remain for all sufficiently large even numbers."

    "example": [
        "Let n=3. Then the considered set is {2,3,5}. The Goldbach representations of 2*k=16 are 3+13, 5+11. Every one of them contains a prime from {2,3,5}. So, a(3)>=8. Since, by the definition, a(3)<=10, consider also 2*k=18 and 20. We have 18=7+11, 20=7+13. These representations contain none of the primes 2,3,5. Therefore, a(3)=8."
