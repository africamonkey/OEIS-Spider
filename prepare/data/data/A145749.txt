        "If n/2 is an odd prime and n+1 is prime then n is in the sequence, the proof is easy. 8,188,285,902,2013,... are terms of the sequence which they aren't of such form. This sequence is a subsequence of A066198.",
        "If p is an odd Sophie Germain prime then 2*p is in the sequence. There is no term of the sequence which is of the form 2*p where p is prime and p isn't Sophie Germain prime. A244438 gives terms of the sequence which isn't of the form 2*p where p is prime. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 14 2014"
