        "The terms 60, 67, and 68 are numbers k such that the k-th semiprime is 3k+5; at k=6919, the k-th semiprime is 4k+5; at k = 613380, 613426, 613558, and 613596, the k-th semiprime is 5k+5; and at k = 58155532, 58155539, 58155541, 58155542, and 58155544, the k-th semiprime is 6k+5. No more terms should be expected up to through at least k = 6*10^9, where the ratio (k-th semiprime)/k is approaching 7. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Dec 17 2017"
