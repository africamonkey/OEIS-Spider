Recall that A119752 is the sequence defined recursively by a(1)=2 and a(k) is the first even number greater than a(k-1) such that 2a(k)+1 is prime and a(k)+a(j)+1 is prime for all 1<=j<k. Let A(1)=A119752, that is, A(1,k)=A119752(k). Then A(n) is the sequence defined recursively as follows: (1) A(n,1) is the first even number not in any A(m), 1<=m<n, such that 2A(n,1)+1 is prime. (2) A(n,k) is the first even number greater than A(n,k-1), not in any A(m), 1<=m<n, such that 2A(n,k)+1 is prime. (3) A(n,k)+A(n,j)+1 is prime for all 1<=j<k.",

        "Let us say that a positive integer t is eventually in A(n) if 2^p*t, p>=1, is in A(n). For example, if t=19, then A(36,1)=2^5*19. The only numbers not eventually in some A(n) are all powers 2^p such that 2^(p+1)+1 is not prime, (so p is not 0, 1, 3, 7, 15) and Sierpinski numbers of the second kind, namely odd integers t such that 2^p*t+1 is composite for all p>=1. The smallest known example is t=78,557."
