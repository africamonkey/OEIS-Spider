        "Refer to arrangement same as A005169: \"A fountain is formed by starting with a row of coins, then stacking additional coins on top so that each new coin touches two in the previous row\". The 3 curves coins patterns consist of a part of each coin circumference and forms a continuous area. There are total 4 distinct patterns. For selected pattern, I would like to call \"3c3s\" type as it cover 3 coins and symmetry. When packing 3c3s into fountain of coins base n, the total number of 3c3s is A008805, the coins left is A008795 and voids left is a(n). See illustration in links."
