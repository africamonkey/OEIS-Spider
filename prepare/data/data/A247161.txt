        "Players A and B bet in a k-round game. Player A has an initial amount of money n. In each round, player A can wager an integer between 0 and what he has. Player A then gains or loses an amount equal to his wager depending on whether player B lets him win or lose. Player B tries to minimize player A's money at the end. The number of rounds player A can lose is r. a(n) is the maximum amount of money player A can have at the end of the game for k = 4 and r = 2.",
