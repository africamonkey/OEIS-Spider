    "comment": [
        "A matrix over GF(2) is an ortho-projection if and only if the matrix is symmetric and idempotent. A labeled ortho-projection graph is a labeled, undirected pseudograph without multiple edges and without multiple loops whose adjacency matrix is an ortho-projection matrix over GF(2). These matrices and graphs arise naturally in low-dimensional topology."
