        "The cumulative sums of the diagonalization of the set of sequences {j-th prime of Erd\u0151s-Selfridge classification k+}. The diagonalization itself is in A101253. a(1) = 2 and a(4) = 751 are primes. a(2) = 21 = 3 * 7, a(3) = 134 = 2 * 67; and a(6) = 11381 = 19 * 599 are semiprime. There are only 2 distinct digits in the greatest factor of a(10) = 11138635 = 5 * 2227727. The cumulative sums of the diagonalization of the related set of sequences {j-th prime of Erd\u0151s-Selfridge classification k-} is A101254. That n- diagonalization itself is in A101231."
