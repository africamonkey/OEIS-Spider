        "Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p-1. The following equivalences holds for i > 1: There is a prime p such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2 iff i^4 - 2 has a prime factor > i; i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2 iff p is a prime factor of i^4 - 2 and p > i. i^4 - 2 has at most three prime factors > i.
