        "The terms are permanents of a set of certain symmetric (0,1)-matrices as detailed in A176211. Thus the sequence solves a symmetric version of Gristein problem: to find all the values of permanent of all square (0,1) matrices, which contain exactly three 1's in each row and column (see the list of unsolved problems in chapter 8 of Minc's book)."
