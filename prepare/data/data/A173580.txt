        "It's possible to use the present sequence for messages coding by the choice of words code such as the Hamming distance (dH) is maximum, for example, with the code (12841,20101,41221,84011), dH = 8, but after error, the decoding with the maximum likelihood is alone insufficient. Then, we use the property of \"prime number word-code\" for improve the decoding."
