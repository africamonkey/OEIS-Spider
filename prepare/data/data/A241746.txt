        "Starting at a(2) = 103, each subsequent term is 60 plus the previous term. Proof: All numbers from 2 to 102 can be scored using 2 darts. For 3 darts, the possible totals are the set of sums of the numbers between 2 and 102 (the 2-dart combinations) and the values for the third dart (see A242718 for allowable scores).  Since the 2-dart scores are continuous in the 2 - 102 range, any value less than 102 plus the maximum 1-dart total can be obtained by selecting the maximum 1-dart score (60) and then choosing the (desired score - 60) from the 2-dart combinations.  For example, to score 95 with 3 darts, assume dart 1 scores 60 and then choose 35 from the 2-dart score list. Thus, the lowest score that cannot be obtained with 3 darts is 61 (the maximum 1-dart score + 1) + 102 (the maximum 2-dart score) = 163.  Repeat this approach for subsequent terms. - _David Consiglio, Jr._, Jun 11 2014"
