In this case, one shelf will hold two books, and the other three shelves will hold one each. There are 4 ways to choose the shelf for two books; there are 20 ways to choose the two books and place them in order on the two-book shelf; there are 6 ways to arrange the other three books on the other three shelves. Hence a(5) = 4(20)(6) = 480."
