        "For prime p let [p] denote the sequence with a(1)=p, and generated as for the terms of the current sequence (which according to this notation is then the same as [2]. It so happens that the sequence [p] (for any p?) merges with [2] sooner or later, taking the form of a \"tree\" as shown in the attached image (Including prime starts up to p=67). Is this pattern of merging bounded or not? Is there just one tree or are there many? Interesting to speculate. The numbers corresponding to the arrival points in [2] of [p] is the sequence 2,6,15,21,51,57,77,84.... The sequence of (\"excluded\")numbers which do not arise in [p] for any prime p starts as 8,16,20,25,28,32,36,44... Other sequences may refer to the number of iterations required to merge [p] into [2]. See tree picture. - _David James Sycamore_, Aug 25 2016",
