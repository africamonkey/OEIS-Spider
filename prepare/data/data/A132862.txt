        "a(n) is an integer multiple of n for all n>=1.",
        "a(n) gives the number of complete binary trees on the n numbers from 1 to n (under the same definition of complete used for heaps) with the property that, at each node of the tree, each left descendant is less than each right descendant. For instance, for n=5, there are 15 such trees, determined by a choice of any value at the root and any of the three smallest remaining values as its left child. a(n) can be computed from an unlabeled complete tree on n nodes as the product of the numbers of descendants of each node (including the node itself). - _David Eppstein_, Mar 18 2016"
