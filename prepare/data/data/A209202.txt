    "comment": [
        "A geometric-arithmetic progression of primes is a set of k primes (denoted by GAP-k) of the form p r^j + j d for fixed p, r and d and consecutive j.  Symbolically, for r = 1, this sequence simplifies to the familiar primes in arithmetic progression (denoted by AP-k).  The computations were done without any assumptions on the form of d. Primality requires d to be even and coprime to 3."
