        "The total surface areas of the smallest possible cuboids (1.1.1), (2.1.1),(2.2.1),(3.1.1) and (4.1.1) are, respectively, 6, 10, 16, 14 and 18 square units, assuming their side lengths are whole numbers. Thus the first two O'Halloran Numbers are 8 and 12 as they do not appear on this list of areas."
