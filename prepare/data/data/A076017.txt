    "comment": [
        "In January of 1968, _Don Knuth_ described the concept of what he called an \"abstract grope\" to the students in his class for sophomore math majors at Caltech.",
        "The students had just learned about abstract groups and he wanted them to get experience doing research with other algebraic axioms; so he challenged them to prove as many interesting things as they could about sets of elements with a binary operator that satisfies the identity x(yx)=y.",
        "The name came from the fact that they were groping for results. Such systems later acquired a more complicated and more dignified yet less memorable name, \"semisymmetric quasigroups\". The students came up with some good stuff, including the concept of normal subgropes."
