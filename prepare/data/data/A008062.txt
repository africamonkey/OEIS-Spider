        "Also, maximal length of a 2-surprising sequence in n symbols. (A sequence of symbols is 2-surprising if, for every pair of symbols X and Y, not necessarily distinct and every distance D, there is at most one position in t he sequence where X precedes Y by distance D.) - _John W. Layman_, Nov 17 2003",
