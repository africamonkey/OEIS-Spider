    "comment": [
        "Start with a number x and construct a successor by the following iterative procedure: first remove all factors 2, 3, 5, ..., p(k) from x, where p(k) is the k-th prime number. When no further such factors remain then take the number ([p(k+1)*x]+1)/2 as the successor. The (3x+1) problem is the special case k=1 in the sequence that lists the p(k+1) leading to a one-cycle.",
        "For other primes there is at least 1 supplementary cycle: e.g. when p(k+1)=11 there is also a cycle starting with 17; when p(k+1)=19 there is also a cycle starting with 46063; when p(k+1)=61 there are 3 supplementary cycles starting resp. with 97, 199, 26833; etc."
