        "Numbers n such that 6^n cannot be written as the average of three distinct cubes.",
        "This sequence is complete. So 6^n can be written as the average of three distinct positive cubes for all n > 15.",
        "Proof: If 6^n = (x^3 + y^3 + z^3)/3, then 6^(n+3) = 6^3 * 6^n = 6^3 * (x^3 + y^3 + z^3)/3 = ((6*x)^3 + (6*y)^3 + (6*z)^3)/3. It is clear that if x, y and z are distinct, then k*x, k*y and k*z are also distinct for all nonzero values of k. So with 6^n also 6^(n+3) is not in the sequence. Therefore, if we can find an integer n such that 6^n, 6^(n+1) and 6^(n+2) are not in the sequence then all 6^m with m >= n will also not be in the sequence. In the example section it is shown that 6^n is not in the sequence for n = 4, 11 and 18. So (4+3*u), (11+3*v) and (18+3*w) cannot be member of this sequence for all nonnegative values of u, v and w. If we choose u=4, v=2 and w=0, we obtain the consecutive values that are 16, 17, 18. Thus this sequence is finite, and all its terms can be found in limited range 0 <= n <= 15."
