        "Also, replace the Y-toothpick with the \"three-diamonds\" symbol, so we have a new cellular automaton in which a(n) counts the total number of diamonds in the structure after the n-th stage, A160120 also gives the total number of \"three-diamonds\" symbols after the n-th stage, and A253770 gives the total number of triangular ON cells after the n-th stage. - _Omar E.
