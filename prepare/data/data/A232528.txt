        "Convenient numbers (A000926) are numbers n such that for all primes p where p and p-n are quadratic residues (mod 4*n), p can be written as x^2 + n*y^2, so convenient numbers are a subsequence.",
        "All non-convenient numbers which are members of this sequence are either congruent to 0 (mod 4) or 3 (mod 4).",
        "The equation 4*p = x^2 + n*y^2 is important because if n is a squarefree integer congruent to 3 (mod 4), then the ring of integers Q[sqrt(-n)] will be all integers of form (x/2) + (y/2)*sqrt(-n) for x and y of the same parity, whose norm is (x/2)^2 + n*(y/2)^2. If prime p = (x/2)^2 + n*(y/2)^2, then 4*p = x^2 + n*y^2.",
