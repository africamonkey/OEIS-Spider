        "The total probability of finding a match of length n digits is exactly 0.9.  That is, we expect 0.9 matches with 1 digit, 0.9 matches with 2 digits, etc.  Increasing the number of digits by a factor of 10 means that we expect to find 0.9 new matches.  Increasing the search from 10^11 to 10^12 (which includes 10 times as much work) would thus only expect to find 0.9 new matches. - _Alan Eliasen_, May 01 2013",
