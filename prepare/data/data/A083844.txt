        "It is conjectured that there are infinitely many primes of the form x^2 + 1 (and thus this sequence never becomes constant), but this has not been proved.",
        "These primes can be found quickly using a sieve based on the fact that numbers of this form have at most one primitive prime factor (A005529). The sum of the reciprocals of these primes is 0.81459657... - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 14 2003"
