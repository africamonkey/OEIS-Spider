        "There are a family of sequences that represent the number of sequences of tosses of a fair coin to n tosses where there are no runs of m or more consecutive heads or consecutive tails. Some are given in this Encyclopedia. Their general form is given as part of the formula below. As n increases, the proportion of sequences of tosses that meet this condition decreases. When that proportion becomes a half or less of the total number of sequences of tosses, there is an even or better chance that a run of m consecutive heads or m consecutive tails occurs.",
        "There is actually a family of sequences of which the above sequence is an instance: those in which, for successive values of m, r*g(n) <= 2^n for r > 1.",
