        "Suppose that f and g are strictly increasing functions for which (f(i)) and (g(j)) are integer sequences.  If 0<|d|<1, the sets F={f(i): i>=1} and G={g(j)+d: j>=1} are clearly disjoint.  Let f^=(inverse of f) and g^=(inverse of g).  When the numbers in F and G are jointly ranked, the rank of f(n) is a(n):=n+floor(g^(f(n))-d), and the rank of g(n)+d is b(n):=n+floor(f^(g(n))+d).  Therefore, the sequences a and b are a complementary pair.",
