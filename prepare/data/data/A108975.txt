        "The poster by Arnold and Monagan reports that the cyclotomic polynomial of order a(6) is the first cyclotomic polynomial whose height is greater than its order. They also report the height of the cyclotomic polynomial Phi(a(7),x) is greater than the order squared. It is also true that k=a(5) is the least order such that the height of Phi(k,x) is greater than the square root of the order. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 22 2008",
