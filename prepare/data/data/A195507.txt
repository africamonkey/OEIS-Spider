        "Conjecture.  {a(n)} satisfies the following recurrence.  Write a(n)/n in lowest terms as num/d.  Then a(n+1)=d*a(n) - (d-1)*n + 1.  llustration:  a(4)=10 and a(4)/4=5/2 in lowest terms.  Then a(5)=2*10-1*4+1=17.  (This has been verified up to a(23)=232792583.)",
        "This follows from the formula below. The value d is 1 unless n is a  prime power p^k, in which case it is p. - Franklin T. Adams-Watters, Sep 20 2011."
