        "Let F be a field of characteristic other than 2. Call a quadratic form over F isotropic if it represents zero nontrivially over F, or anisotropic otherwise. The u-invariant of a field F is the supremum of the dimensions of anisotropic quadratic forms over F.",
        "It is folklore that 3, 5, and 7 are not in this sequence, see for example Proposition 6.8 in Lam 2005 chapter XI. Merkurjev showed that a(4) = 6, and more generally (see Merkur\u02b9ev 1991) that 2n is in this sequence for n > 0. Izhboldin showed that a(6) = 9. It is not known if 11, 13, 15, ... are in this sequence, see Question 6.4 in chapter XIII in Lam 2005."
