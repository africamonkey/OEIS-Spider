        "Inspired by attempt to determine what incorrectly-named A000519 may really be. Conjecture: Sequence is number of different main-diagonal sums among Latin squares of order n. Confirmed for first five terms. Guaranteed to be an upper bound as the diagonal sum can only be in the range from n to n^2 inclusive and it is impossible for the sum to be n+1 or n^2-1. There is probably an easy proof that all other sums in this interval can be realized as the only restriction seems to be that it is not permissible for exactly n-1 numbers on a diagonal to be identical."
