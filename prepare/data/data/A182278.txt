        "The sequence A068869 is statistically growing, but I conjecture that there are infinitely many indices n such that A068869(n)<A068869(n-1). However, we don't yet know whether there are two consecutive integers in the sequence, i.e., a term n such that, additionally to the above, A068869(n+1)<A068869(n).",
