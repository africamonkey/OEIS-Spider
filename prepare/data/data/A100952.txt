        "A weaker conjecture: every integer greater than 60 (or some larger value based on further search) may be partitioned into a prime p and a semiprime qr, where the prime p is bounded by log(min(q,r)). Chen (1978) showed that all sufficiently large even numbers are the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes. Zumkeller's conjecture effectively extends this from \"even\" to both even and odd integers. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Nov 25 2004",
