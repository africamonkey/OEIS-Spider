        "Because of the Gregorian Calendar Reform of 1582 these terms are fictitious, strictly speaking. They are valid only then, if we adopt the reform for dates before 1582, subsequently. To get the real number of days after 'Jan 1 1000' for years after 1582 subtract 5 from terms representing a date after 1582 (these are the terms with n higher than 61). The value 5 comes from the 10 skipped \"Gregorian\" days between Oct 4 and Oct 15 1582 minus the 5 additional Julian leap days in the years 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400 and 1500 which are not Gregorian leap years.",

The first palindromic date after 'Jan 01 2000' is 10022001 which is the 62nd term of the sequence A210886.
