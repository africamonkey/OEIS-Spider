        "Sequence can be used to find the largest highly composite number in subsequences of A212165 (of which there are several in the database).",
        "Ramanujan showed that, in the canonical prime factorization of a highly composite number with largest prime factor p(n), the largest exponent cannot exceed 2[log p(n+1)/log 2]. (See formula 54 on page 15 of the Ramanujan paper.) This limit is less than n for all n >= 9 (and p(n) >= 23).",
        "1. Direct calculation verifies this for 9 <= n <= 11.",
        "2. Nagura proved that, for any integer m >= 25, there is always a prime between m and 1.2*m.  Let n = 11, at which point p(11) = 31 and log p(n+1)/log 2 = log 37/log 2 = 5.209453.... Since log 1.2/log 2 is only .263034..., it follows that n must increase by at least 3k before 2[log p(n+1)/log 2] can increase by 2k, for all values of k. Therefore, 2[log p(n+1)/log 2] can never catch up to p(n) for n > 11.",
        "665280 = 2^6*3^3*5*7*11 is the largest highly composite number whose prime factorization contains an exponent that is strictly greater than the number of positive exponents in that factorization (including the implied 1s)."
