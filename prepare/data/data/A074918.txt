        "A perfect number n is defined by sigma(n) = 2n, so the value of i(n) = |sigma(n)-2n| measures the degree of perfection of n. The larger i(n) is, the more \"imperfect\" n is. I call the numbers n such that i(k) < i(n) for all k < n \"highly-imperfect numbers\".",

        "The last odd term is a(79) = 719. (Proof: sigma(27720n) >= 11080n, and so sigma(27720n) >= 4 * 27720(n + 1) for n >= 8, so there is no odd member of this sequence between 27720 * 8 and 27720 * 9, between 27720 * 9 and 2770 * 10, etc.; the remaining terms are checked by computer.)
