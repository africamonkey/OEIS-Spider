        "If n is of the form 4^i*(8j+7) (where i>=0, j>=0) then n^3 is not in the sequence because n^3 is of the mentioned form so n^3 is in A004215 hence according to the definition n^3 is not in this sequence (see formula for A004215). Hence 7^3, 15^3, 23^3, 28^3, 31^3, 39^3, ... are not in the sequence. Is there a number n such that n^3 is not in the sequence but n is not of the form 4^i*(8j+7)? - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Nov 23 2006",
        "A number n^3 belongs to this sequence iff and only n is sum of three squares. Proof is immediate from Catalan's identity (x^2+y^2+z^2)^3=x^2(3z^2-x^2-y^2)^2+y^2(3z^2-x^2-y^2)^2+z^2(z^2-3x^2-3y^2)^2. - _Artur Jasinski_, Dec 09 2006",
        "If n=a^2+b^2+c^2, then n^3=(na)^2+(nb)^2+(nc)^2. Conversely, suppose there were an n such that n^3 is in A000378 but n is not. Then n must be of form 4^k*(8i+7). But n^3 would also be of the form 4^k*(8i+7) and thus n^3 would not be in A000378, contradicting the original assumption. This argument is easily extended to all odd powers, i.e. n^(2k+1) is in A000378 iff n is in A000378. [From _Ray Chandler_, Feb 03 2009]"
