        "10 is not in the sequence because all 10^k-2 are even and 10^k-1 are divisible by 3 (because 10^k mod 3 = 1 as 10 mod 3 =1). 16 is not in the sequence because 16^k-2 are even and because 16^k-1 are divisible by 3 (because 16^k mod 3 = 1 as 16 mod 3 =1). For the same reason almost all even numbers of the form 3m+1 (A016957) are absent, the only exception being 4 where 4^1-1 is a prime. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 22 2015",
        "36 is not in the sequence because 36^k-1 are even and 36^k-1 are divisible by 5 (because 36^k mod 5 =1 as 36 mod 5 =1). This reasoning excludes all numbers of A017341 (except 6 where 6^1-1 is prime) from this sequence. With the same methology we can fish for (and exclude) even numbers of the form m*p+1 for primes p>=3. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 22 2015"
