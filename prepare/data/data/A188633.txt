        "Positive even integers are closed under addition and multiplication. There is no zero and no unit, but the singly even numbers become \"primes,\" and all positive even numbers can be factored into primes.",
        "But unique factorization does not hold. Numbers of the form 4pq, where p is an odd prime and q is any odd integer greater than 1, can be factored as 2(2pq) or as 2p 2q; these are distinct since 2, 2pq, 2p and 2q are all singly even numbers.",
        "For higher k, (2^k)m can have more than two factorizations if Omega(m) >= k, with Omega(n) being the number of prime factors counted with multiplicity (A001222)."
