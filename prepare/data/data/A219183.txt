        "This is to semiprimes A001358 as A219117 is to primes A000040. Extension by Franklin T. Adams-Watters. From Robert Gerbicz: there is no n for which n^k+n+1 is semiprime for k=1,2,3,4,5. Proof: n^5+n+1 = (n^2+n+1)*(n^3-n^2+1), here n^2+n+1 is semiprime, so for n > 1, n^5+n+1 has at least 3 factors, hence not a semiprime."
