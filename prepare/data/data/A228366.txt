        "In order to construct this sequence we use the following rules:",
        "We start in the first quadrant of the square grid with no toothpicks, so a(0) = 0.",
        "At stage n we place the smallest possible number of toothpicks of length 1 connected by their endpoints in horizontal direction starting from the grid point (0, n) such that the x-coordinate of the exposed endpoint of the last toothpick is not equal to the x-coordinate of any outer corner of the structure. Then we place toothpicks of length 1 connected by their endpoints in vertical direction, starting from the exposed toothpick endpoint, downward up to touch the structure or up to touch the x-axis.",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n stages. A228367 (the first differences) gives the number of toothpicks added at the n-th stage.",
        "Note that the number of toothpick of added at n-th stage in horizontal direction is also A001511(n) and the number of toothpicks added at n-th stage in vertical direction is also A006519(n). Also counting both the x-axis and the y-axis we have that A001511(n) is also the largest part of the n-th region of the diagram and A006519(n) is also the number of parts of the n-th region of the diagram.",
        "After 2^k stages a new section of the structure is completed, so the structure can be interpreted as a diagram of the 2^(k-1) compositions of k in colexicographic order, if k >= 1 (see A228525). The infinite diagram can be interpreted as a table of compositions of the positive integers."
