        "Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p - 1. The following equivalences holds for i > 1: There is a prime p such that i is a solution mod p of x^3 = 2 iff i^3 - 2 has a prime factor > i; i is a solution mod p of x^3 = 2 iff p is a prime factor of i^3 - 2 and p > i. i^3 - 2 has at most two prime factors > i. For i such that i^3 - 2 has no prime factors > i; cf. A060591."
