        "Abundancy is defined as the ratio of the multiplicative sum-of-divisors function to the integer itself: abund(n) = sigma(n)/n. E.g., abund(10) = sigma(10) / 10 = (1+2+5+10) / 10 = 1.8 = 9 / 5.",
        "Integers m and n are friendly if and only if they have the same abundancy. E.g., abund(12) = abund(234) = 7 / 3, so 12 and 234 are friends.",
        "Integers which have no friends are called solitary.",
