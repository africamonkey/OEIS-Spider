        "Partial sums of Dedekind numbers. Partial sums of number of monotone Boolean functions of n variables (increasing functions from P(S), the set of subsets of S, to {0,1}). Partial sums of number of antichains of subsets of an n-set. The subsequence of primes in this partial sum begins: 2, 5, 11, 31, 199 is prime (5 in a row, then no more known)."
