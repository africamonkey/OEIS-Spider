        "Also numbers n for which the following equation holds : (2^r)-sigma_0(p(1)*...*p(r)) = 0. This sequence describes the way RMS numbers (A140480) are grouped. In general if n = p(1)^alpha(1) *...* p(s)^alpha(s), alpha(i)>=1, we have the equation [2^sum_i=1..s{alpha(i)}] - sigma_0(p(1)^alpha(1) *...* p(s)^alpha(s)) = T. In terms of OEIS sequences the equation is : 2^(A001055(n)) - (A000005(n)) = T. This sequence has T=0, n=p(1)*...*p(r). If T=(2^k)-(k+1) then n=p^k. T splits the set of integers into subsets according to the form of prime factorization of the number n.",
        "These can be computed with a modified Sieve of Eratosthenes: [1] start at n=2, [2] if (n is crossed out an even number of times) then (append n to the sequence and cross out all multiples of n), [3] set n:=n+1 and go to step 2; compare with the sieve for the complement of perfect powers in A007916. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Mar 19 2009",
