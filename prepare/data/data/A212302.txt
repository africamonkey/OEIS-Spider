        "Sequence could be called the \"odious-perfect numbers\".",
        "By the Euclid-Euler theorem, an even number n is perfect (A000396) if and only if n=2^(k-1)*(2^k-1), where 2^k-1 is prime. From this it follows that all even perfect numbers more than 6 have only odious divisors (A000069). Therefore, they all are in this sequence. However, the sequence also contains non-perfect numbers. The first two such numbers are 415800 and 2096128 (and no others up to 10^11). Comparing this sequence with A230587, one can see that the terms of this sequence are much rarer. It is an interesting phenomenon."
