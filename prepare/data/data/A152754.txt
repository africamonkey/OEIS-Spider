    "comment": [
        "In the mapping: every integer m corresponds to a unique pair (k,l) with m=A000695(k)+2A000695(l) (k=A059905(m), l=A059906(m)), the numbers a(n) are mapped into the lattice points lying upper the diagonal l=k. If the binary expansion of N is Sum b_j*2^j, then N is in the sequence iff Sum b_(2j)*2^j<Sum b_(2j+1)*2^j. Therefore \"in average\" satisfies the condition of A139370. This explains, somewhat, why many terms of the sequence are in A139370 as well."
