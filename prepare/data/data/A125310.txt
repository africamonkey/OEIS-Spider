        "Since any proper divisor of a perfect number is deficient, all perfect numbers are (trivially) included in the sequence.",
        "Hence the interesting terms of the sequence are its non-perfect terms, which I call \"deficiently perfect\". 90 is the only such term < 10^8. Are there any more?",
        "If a(n) were defined to be those numbers that are equal to the sum of their deficient divisors, then the sequence would begin with 1.  So, up to 10^10, the only non-perfect numbers in that sequence would be 1 (a deficient number) and 90 (an abundant number). - _Timothy L. Tiffin_, Jan 08 2013",
