        "Let H(n,b) be the Hamming graph whose vertices are the sequences of length n over the alphabet {0,1,...,b-1} with adjacency being defined by having Hamming distance 1. Let P(n,b) be the subgraph of H(n,b) induced by the set of vertices which are base b representations of primes with n digits (not allowing leading 0 digits).",
        "For 6 and 7 digit primes there is a single large component and the remaining components have size 1. For 8 digit primes there is a single large component, the size 2 component {89391959, 89591959} and the remaining components have size 1. [_W. Edwin Clark_, Mar 31 2009]",
