    "comment": [
        "a(n) is the number of complete rooted binary trees with n leaves in which the internal nodes are labelled either white or black; the two children (subtrees) of a white node have no specified orientation, but the two children (subtrees) of a black node are labelled left and right.  Thus the notion of isomorphism for these trees is partly planar (for the black nodes) and partly abstract (for the white nodes).",
        "Finding a recurrence relation is an easy exercise.  Finding an exact formula is probably very difficult or even impossible: compare the OEIS page for A001190 (Wedderburn-Etherington numbers)."
