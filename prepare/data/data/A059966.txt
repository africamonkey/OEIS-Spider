        "In music, the number of distinct rhythms, at a given tempo, produced by a continuous repetition of measures with identical patterns of 1's and 0's (where 0 means no beat, and 1 means one beat), where each measure allows for n possible beats of uniform character, and when counted under these two conditions: (i) the starting and ending times for the measure are unknown or irrelevant and (ii) identical rhythms that can be produced by using a measure with fewer than n possible beats are excluded from the count. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Apr 22 2013",
