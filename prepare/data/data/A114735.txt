        "A flat polynomial is defined to be a polynomial whose coefficients are -1, 0, or 1. Order n means that k is the product of n distinct odd primes. Although the first four numbers are triangular (A000217), this appears to be a coincidence. Are there flat cyclotomic polynomials of all orders?",
