        "Let tau be transform map tau: 0->01, 1->10. By definition A286685 equals tau(b), where b is the Pell word. The words of length 2 occurring in b are 00, 01 and 10. These are mapped by tau to tau(00) = 0101, tau(01) = 0110, tau(10) = 1001.",
        "Each of these three four letter words contains exactly 2 1's, occuring among the first two letters and among the last two letters. It follows from this, that the overlapping words of length 2 in the Pell word b induce distances between 1's in tau(b) of 2 for 00, of 1 for 01, and of 3 for 10. But then the difference sequence (a(n+1) - a(n)) = 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2,... is equal to the 1->2, 2->1 permuted version of the 3-symbol Pell word A294180. (End)"
