        "Note that the cube analog \"Numbers whose digit sum as well as sum of the cubes of the digits is a prime\" only occurs when A007953(n) = Digital sum (i.e. sum of digits) of n) = 2, as otherwise A055012(n) = Sum of cubes of digits of n = 2, i.e., n = 2, 11, 20, 101, 110, 1001, 1010, ... since for natural numbers A^3 + B^3 is divisible by A+B. Hence \"Numbers whose digit sum as well as sum of the cubes of the digits is a prime\" begins 2, 11, 101, ... . - _Jonathan Vos Post_, May 10 2012"
