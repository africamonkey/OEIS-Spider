    "comment": [
        "The sums are the difference of two triangular numbers A000217. The common numbers themselves are A094550. The sums, n > 0, are n = (b-a+1)(a+b)/2 = (b+c)(c-b+1)/2 where b^2 + a - a^2 = c^2 + c - b^2, is solvable in integers for 0 < a < b < c. Since the runs have something in common, they are \"friends\". The series of sums *without* the common number is A110702. The numbers common to the two runs are A094550."
