    "comment": [
        "This is to the pentanacci sequence as A055502 is to the Fibonacci sequence and A113823 is to the tribonacci sequence (i.e., least prime greater than the sum of the previous 2 terms in A055502, least prime greater than the sum of the previous 3 terms in A113823, least prime greater than the sum of the previous 5 terms in this sequence)."

    "formula": [
        "a(-n) = a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, for n>1: a(n) = smallest prime > a(n-1)+a(n-2)+a(n-3)+a(n-4)+a(n-5)."
    ],
    "example": [
        "a(6) = 59 because a(1)+a(2)+a(3)+a(4)+a(5) = 2+3+7+13+29 = 54, the smallest prime beyond 54 is 59.",
        "a(10) = 877 because a(5)+a(6)+a(7)+a(8)+a(9) = 29 + 59 + 113 + 223 + 439 = 863 is prime, the next prime being 14 more, namely 877."
