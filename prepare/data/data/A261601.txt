        "In 2006, Buch et al. introduced a new combinatorial algorithm called Hecke insertion, which is a K-theoretic analog of the well-known Schensted algorithm for the insertion of a word into a semistandard Young tableau. The Hecke insertion algorithm results in a strictly increasing tableau. An important difference between Knuth equivalence and K-Knuth equivalence is that, while insertion equivalence via the Schensted algorithm (resp. the Hecke algorithm) implies Knuth equivalence (resp. K-Knuth equivalence), the converse holds for the standard version but not for the K-theoretic version. In other words, two words can be K-Knuth equivalent but insert into different tableaux via the Hecke insertion algorithm."
