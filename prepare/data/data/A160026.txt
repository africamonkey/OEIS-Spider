        "For primes p, q, r the sum p^4+q^4+r^4 can be prime only if at least one of p, q, r equals 3. This sequence is the special case q = 17, r = 3.",
        "It is conjectured that the sequence is infinite.",
        "There are consecutive primes (1901, 1907) in the sequence."

    "example": [
        "p = 3: 3^4+17^4+3^4 = 83683 = 67*1249, so 3 is not in the sequence.",
        "p = 1901: 1901^4+17^4+3^4 = 13059557751203 is prime, so 1901 is in the sequence.",
        "p = 1907: 1907^4+17^4+3^4 = 13225216032803 is prime, so 1907 is in the sequence."
