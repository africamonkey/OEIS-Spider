        "Pi = 3.1415926... is an irrational number and can't be exactly represented by a fraction with rational numerator and denominators. The fraction 355/113 is so accurate that improves the approximation of Pi by five significant digits over the previous 333/106. To find a slightly more accurate approximation we have to go to 52163 / 16604. - _Sergio Pimentel_, Sep 13 2005",
        "The approximations 22/7 and 355/113 were already known by Zu Chongzhi (5th century) and A. Metius, 1585. (Thanks to P. Curtz for this remark.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 03 2013",
        "The approximation 355/113 was used by S. Ramanujan in the paper \"Squaring the circle\" J. of the Indian Math.
