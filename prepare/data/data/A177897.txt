        "A generalization: Denote {a_k(n)}_(n>=0) the sequence of triangle of 2^k-nomial coefficients [read by rows: n-th row is obtained by expanding ((1+x)*(1+x^2)*...*(1+x^(2^(k-1)))^n ] mod 2 converted to decimal. Then a_k(n)=A001317((2^k-1)*n). [Proof is based on the fact (following from the Lucas theorem for the binomial coefficients) that the k-th row of Pascal triangle contains odd coefficients only iff k is Mersenne number (k=2^m-1)]."
