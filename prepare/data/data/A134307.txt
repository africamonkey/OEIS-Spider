        "It's worth observing that there are p-1 elements of order dividing p-1 modulo p^2 that are of the form r^(k*p) mod p^2 where r is a primitive element modulo p and k=0,1,...,p-2. Heuristically, one can expect that at least one of them belongs to the interval [2,p-1] with probability about 1 - (1 - 1/p)^(p-1) ~= 1 - 1/e.",
        "Numerically, among the primes below 1000 (out of the total number pi(1000)=168) there are 103 terms of the sequence, and the ratio 103/168 = 0.613 which is already somewhat close to 1-1/e ~= 0.632.",
        "If we replace p^2 with p^3, heuristically it is likely that the sequence is finite (since 1 - (1 - 1/p^2)^(p-1) tends to 0 as p grows). - _Max Alekseyev_, Jan 09 2009",
        "Replacing p^2 with p^3 gives just the one term (113) for p < 10^6. - _Joerg Arndt_, Jan 07 2011",
        "If furthermore the number A can be taken to be a primitive root modulo p, i.e., A is a generator of (Z/pZ)*, then that p belongs to A060503. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Jul 31 2015"
