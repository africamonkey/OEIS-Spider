    "name": "Arrange the distinct prime divisors of each non-prime-power positive integer n in order from smallest to largest. n is included in sequence A141698 if the differences between consecutive primes in the arrangement of primes are all powers of 2 (including possibly 1).",
    "example": [
        "84 has the prime factorization 2^2 *3^1 *7^1. So the distinct primes dividing 84 are 2,3 and 7. 3-2=1, a power of 2. And 7-3 = 4, also a power of 2. So 84 is included in this sequence."
