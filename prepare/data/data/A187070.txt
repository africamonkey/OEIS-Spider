        "1. Definitions. Let T_(7,j,0) denote the rhombus with sides of unit length (=1), interior angles given by the pair (j*Pi/7,(7-j)*Pi/7) and Area(T_(7,j,0))=sin(j*Pi/7), j in {1,2,3}. Associated with T_(7,j,0) are its angle coefficients (j, 7-j) in which one coefficient is even while the other is odd. A half-tile is created by cutting T_(7,j,0) along a line extending between its two corners with even angle coefficient; let H_(7,j,0) denote this half-tile. Similarly, a T_(7,j,r) tile is a linearly scaled version of T_(7,j,0) with sides of length x^r and Area(T_(7,j,r))=x^(2*r)*sin(j*Pi/7), r>=0 an integer, where x is the positive, constant square root x=sqrt[(2*cos(j*Pi/7))^2 - 1]; likewise let H_(7,j,r) denote the corresponding half-tile. Often H_(7,i,r) (i in {1,2,3}) can be subdivided into an integral number of each equivalence class H_(7,j,0). But regardless of whether or not H_(7,j,r) subdivides, in theory such a proposed subdivision for each j can be represented by the matrix M=(m_(i,j)), i,j=1,2,3, in which the entry m_(i,j) gives the quantity of H_(7,j,0) tiles that should be present in a subdivided H_(7,i,r) tile. The number x^(2*r) (the square of the scaling factor) is an eigenvalue of M=(U_2)^r, where",

Then a(n)=a(2*r+i-1)=m_(i,3), where M=(m_(i,j))=(U_2)^r was defined above. Hence the block C_r corresponds component-wise to the third column of M, and a(n)=m_(i,3) gives the quantity of H_(7,3,0) tiles that should appear in a subdivided H_(7,i,r) tile. (End)",
