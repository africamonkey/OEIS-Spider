        "For sums of two positive octagonal numbers, see A136345. This is to octagonal numbers A000567 as A089982 is to triangular numbers A000217, as A009000 is to squares A000290, as A136117 is to pentagonal numbers A000326, as A133215 is to hexagonal numbers A000384, and as A117104 is to heptagonal numbers A000566. If Oc(a) + Oc(b) = Oc(c) then a(3a-2) + b(3b+2) = c(3c+2), so solving the quadratic equations for c we have (when an integer): c = (2 + sqrt(4 + 36a^2 + 36b^2 - 24a - 24b))/6."
