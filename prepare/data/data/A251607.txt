    "comment": [
        "Acute integer triangles ABC with largest side BC of length n (A247588) are segregated from obtuse or right integer triangles with the same largest side BC (A236384) by the closed boundary formed by a semicircle and BC as its diameter. The right integer triangles will lie on this boundary and the obtuse integer triangles within this boundary. Define a closed boundary S(q) that is formed by BC and a locus of points whose real distance from B is x, from C is y and x^q+y^q=n^q for integer q>0. Then S(2) is that closed boundary formed by a semicircle with BC as diameter. Euler proved that there are no integer triangles that lie on S(3) and Wiles for all S(q) where q>2. This sequence identifies all integer triangles with largest side BC of length n that lie inside S(3)."
