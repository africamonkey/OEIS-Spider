        "A squarefree and rich word over a fixed alphabet always has bounded length (see Pelantov\u00e1 & Starosta). A word is squarefree if it does not contain squares as subwords, and a word of length n is rich if it contains exactly n+1 distinct palindromes (including the empty word) as subwords.",
