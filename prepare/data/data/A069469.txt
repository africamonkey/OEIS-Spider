        "For an arithmetical function f, call the arguments n such that f(reverse(n)) = reverse(f(n)) the \"palinpoints\" of f. This sequence is the sequence of palinpoints of f(n) = prime(n).",
        "These are all the palinpoints of prime(n) not exceeding 10^7. There are more (535252535 is known to be a term, but it is not known whether it is the next one).",
        "Contains all n such that n and prime(n) are both palindromes, i.e. A046942. Heuristically, we would expect there to be infinitely many of these, but they will be rare: the number of them with at most d digits may be on the order of sqrt(d). - _Robert Israel_, May 30 2016",
