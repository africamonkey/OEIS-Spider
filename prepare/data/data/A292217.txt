    "comment": [
        "Up to the known 1593 sociable number cycles, 96.1% of the sociable number cycles satisfy this condition (up to the first 10 sociable number cycles: 40%; up to the first 100 sociable number cycles: 77%; up to the first 500 sociable number cycles: 92%, and up to the first 1000 sociable number cycles: 94.9%). So the conjecture here is that as the number of sociable number cycles increases, the percentage of the sums of the sociable number cycles divisible by 10 approaches 100%. Notice that the sums of amicable pairs are similarly often divisible by 10, but are not included here (see A291422)."
