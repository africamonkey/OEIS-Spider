        "Carlitz compositions are compositions where adjacent parts are distinct. They are enumerated in sequence A003242.",
        "In Hadjicostas and Zhang (2017), compositions that either have length 1, or have length greater than or equal to 2 and are palindromic, if we exclude the first part, are called type II palindromic compositions, while the usual palindromic compositions are called type I palindromic compositions. (Type I palindromic compositions that are Carlitz are enumerated in sequence A239327.)",
        "Since in a Carlitz composition adjacent parts are distinct, type II palindromic compositions of length > 1 that are Carlitz must have an even number of parts."

Similarly, the composition 2+1+3+1 becomes palindromic, i.e., 1+3+1, if we remove the first part. A composition of length one, such as 7, is considered palindromic of both types, I and II.)"
