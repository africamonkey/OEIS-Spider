    "comment": [
        "A graph with e edges is 'b^{hat} graceful' if its nodes can be labeled with distinct nonnegative integers so that, if each edge is labeled with the absolute difference between the labels of its endpoints, then the e edges have the distinct labels 1, 2, ..., e.",
        "Equivalently, maximum m for which there's a difference basis with respect to m with n elements. A 'difference basis w.r.t. m' is a set of integers such that every integer from 1 to m is a difference between two elements of the set."
