        "Number of times the line y=x/n intersects the cycloid specified by x=t-sin(t), y=1-cos(t) or, by symmetry, number of times the line y=n*x intersects the cycloid specified by x=1-cos(t), y=t-sin(t). It is equal to twice the number of arches that are intersected by the lines (2 intersection points by arch).",
        "To find this sequence one can look for the slopes of the tangents to the n-th arch when these tangents pass through the origin (see pari script). If one consider the indices where a(n) change value, one gets: 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, ... that may well be A062389, as this is the slope of the line joining the origin to the summit of the n-th arch. Will this be true for all n? - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 29 2013"
