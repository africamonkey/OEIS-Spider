    "comment": [
        "'Reverse and Subtract' (cf. A072137) is defined by x -> |x - reverse(x)|. There is no number k > 0 such that |k - reverse(k)| = k, so 0 is the only period with length 1. Consequently this sequence consists of the numbers n such that repeated application of 'Reverse and Subtract' does not lead to a palindrome. It is an analog of A023108, which uses 'Reverse and Add'. - A072141, A072142, A072143 give the numbers which generate periods of length 2, 14, 22 respectively."
