        "This sequence is finite. For any n, the largest digit sum possible is 9*A055642(n). Let n contain M digits. In order for n to be a palindrome and n + digsum(n) to be a palindrome, if digsum(n) affects the k-th digit of n, it must also affect the (M-k)-th digit of n for k = 1, 2, ..., M-1. For example, if n is 5 digits long and digsum(n) is 2 digits long, then n + digsum(n) and n - digsum(n) must affect the digit in the thousands place of n in order to produce a palindrome. This means that digsum(n) must be at least 4 digits long. Generally, we can say that A055642(digsum(n)) >= A055642(n)-A055642(digsum(n))+1 and thus, A055642(digsum(n)) >= (1/2)*(A055642(n)+1). This, however, fails when n > 3 digits. When n is 4 digits, the maximum that the digit sum could be is 36, a 2-digit number. Since it is a 2-digit number, it must affect the digit in the hundreds place of n when it is added to or subtracted from n. However, this is not possible since digsum(n) is only 2 digits long. When n > 4, the argument is similar."
