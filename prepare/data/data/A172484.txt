    "comment": [
        "Every natural number, written in base 10, is either economical A046759 (also called frugal), or equidigital A046758, or extravagant (or prodigal or wasteful). An extravagant number is one for which the factorization requires more digits that the original number such as 30 = 2 * 3 * 5. The subsequence of economical partial sums of extravagant numbers begins: xxx, 18, 39, 57, 77, 99, 207, 240, 274, 310. The subsequence of equidigital partial sum of economical numbers begins: 10, 27, 123, 149, 177, 427, 469 (such as 1207 = 17 * 71). The subsequence of prime partial sums of economical numbers begins: xxx, 149, 859, 2477, 2833."
