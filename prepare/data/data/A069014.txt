        "At n=163, exp(Pi*sqrt(n)) is remarkably close to its nearest integer, differing from it by less than 7.5*10^-13. Consequently, for values of n=163*k^2 where k is a sufficiently small integer greater than 1, exp(Pi*sqrt(n)) = exp(Pi*sqrt(163*k^2)) = exp(Pi*sqrt(163)*k) = (exp(Pi*sqrt(163)))^k will also be close to an integer. If we exclude numbers of the form 163*k^2 for k=2..4, then the number of values of n < 10^7 at which exp(Pi*sqrt(n)) differs from its nearest integer by less than 10^-6 is 21, which about what we would expect if we were instead generating random numbers whose fractional parts followed a uniform distribution on the interval [0,1). If the fractional parts continue to behave in this way, then we could expect about a 50% chance of finding a(10) at some value below log(2)/(2u) = 4.62*10^11 where u = abs(t - round(t)) and t = exp(Pi*sqrt(163)). - _Jon E.
