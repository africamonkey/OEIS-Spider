        "A very simple sieve for the generation of the terms is the following: Let p_n be the n-th prime. Consider consecutive intervals of the form (2p_n, 2p_{n+1}), n=1,2,... From every interval containing at least one prime we take the first one and remove it from the set of all primes. Then all remaining primes form the sequence. Let us demonstrate this sieve: For primes 2,3,5,7,11,... consider intervals (4,6), (6,10), (10,14), (14,22), (22,26), (26,34), ... . Removing from the set of all primes the first prime of each interval, i.e., 5,7,11,17,23,29,... ,we obtain 2,3,13,19,31, etc.",
