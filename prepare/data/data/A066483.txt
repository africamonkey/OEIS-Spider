        "Something is wrong. The definition produces A062239, not the present sequence. Either the definition or the terms are wrong. - _Harry J. Smith_, Feb 17 2010",
        "The terms this sequence ought to have to be correct to its original definition are: 222, 333, 555, 777, 2222, 2232, 2322, 2772, 3222, 3333, 3555, 5355, 5535, 5555, 5775, 7777, 22222, 22332, 22722, 23232, 23322, 27272, 32232, 32322, 33222, 33333, 33555, 35355, 35535, 37737. The only explanation I can think of for their absence is that the sequence was computed by hand and these numbers were overlooked. - _Alonso del Arte_, Dec 05 2011"
