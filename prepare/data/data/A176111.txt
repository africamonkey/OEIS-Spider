        "The set of Honaker primes A033584 is intersected with the set {37, 73, 109, 127, 163, 181, 271, 307, 397, 433, 523, 541, 577, 613,...} of primes p = 2k-1, where A007953(p) = A007953(k) for the digit sums.",
        "The requirement on the digit sum defining the Honaker primes plus the additional requirement on the digits sum of k means both digit sums are of the form 9*m+1, m>=1.",
        "The sequence contains prime(n) for n = 595, 820, 847, 982, 1009, 1099, 1468, 15856, 1693, 1747,...",
        "The fourth to sixth member of the sequence are three consecutive Honaker primes.",
        "As a curiosity we have that for p=120709 = prime(11359) = A033584(469), k=60355 even the index in the Honaker primes has the same sum, 19."
