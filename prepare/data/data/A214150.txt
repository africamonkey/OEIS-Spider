        "p^2 - 25 does contain the prime factors 2, 3, but not 5: p - 5 and p + 5 are not divisible by 5 and p^2 - 25 is divisible by 24 as primes are 1 or 2 mod 3 and thus p - 5 or p + 5 are 0 mod 3 and primes are 1 or 3 mod 4 and thus p - 5 or p + 5 are 0 mod 4 and both p - 5 and p + 5 are even.",
