        "Prime quintuplets (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12) are one of the two types of densest permissible constellations of 5 primes. Maximal gaps between quintuplets of this type are listed in A201062; see more comments there."

        "The gap of 90 between quintuplets starting at p=7 and p=97 is the very first gap, so a(1)=97. The gap of 1770 between quintuplets starting at p=97 and p=1867 is a maximal (record) gap - larger than any preceding gap; therefore a(2)=1867. The gap after p=1867 is smaller, so a new term is not added."
