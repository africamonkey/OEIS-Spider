Also 10 belongs belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {|0,1}, where, as the option 0 dominates the option 1, the latter can be deleted, resulting the same game {|0}. Likewise code 8589934592 (= 2^(1+(2*2^(2*2)))) belongs into this sequence, as it encodes the game {|{-1|}}, which is reversible to game -1."
