        "Partial answer: a(n) << n log n/(log log n)^k for any k. Proof: Since 0 is a Fibonacci number, and Fibonacci numbers are periodic mod any number, 2^(k+1) divides infinitely many Fibonacci numbers. Take some positive Fibonacci number F divisible by 2^(k+1). By Landau's theorem there are >> x (log log x)^k/log x odd squarefree numbers divisible by k+1 primes up to x. Multiply each by 2^(F/2^(k+1)-1) which leaves the density unchanged since the expression is constant in k, and note that the products have exactly F divisors. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 16 2015"
