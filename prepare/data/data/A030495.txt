        "a(n) is also the maximum size for a deck of cards in the Communicating the Card magic trick. In this game Alice draws n+1 cards from the deck at random, without replacement, and passes n of them, one by one, to her accomplice Bob. If the deck has a(n) cards or fewer, there is an algorithm by which Alice can communicate to Bob the identity of the card she chooses to retain, using only the identity and the order of passing of the n passed cards. (One side of the proof, that no larger deck size will work, is easy: the retained card can be one of (n+1)! possibilities, since Bob knows that it is not one of the n passed cards. Alice has (n+1) ways to retain a card and n! ways to order the passing of the remaining cards, so she cannot communicate more than (n+1)! different possibilities.) - _Lee A. Newberg_, Jun 09 2010"
