        "Note that for 22 of the first 80 Poulet numbers, we obtained through this formula another Poulet number!",
        "The formula could be generalized this way: Poulet numbers that can be written as (n + 1)*p^2 - n*p, where n is natural, n > 0, and p is another Poulet number.",
        "For n = 1, that formula becomes the formula set out for the sequence above.",
        "For n = 2, that formula becomes 3*p^2 - 2*p, from which the Poulet numbers 348161 (for p = 341) and 1246785 (for p = 645) were obtained.",
        "For n = 3, that formula becomes 4*p^2 - 3*p, from which the Poulet number 119273701 (for p = 5461) was obtained.",
        "For n = 4, that formula becomes 5*p^2 - 4*p, from which the Poulet numbers 2077545 (for p = 645) and 9613297 (for p = 1387) were obtained.",
