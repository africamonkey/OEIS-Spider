    "comment": [
        "If 7 divides neither m nor n, then from Fermat's little theorem, 7 divides M^3 - N^3 =( alpha)*Q, where alpha= M - N and Q=M^2 + M*N + N^2, with M=m^2, N=n^2; Here we have (alpha)^2 + (beta)^2 = (gamma)^2, with (beta)^2 =4*M*N and (gamma)^2=M + N. Thus if further 7 does not divide alpha, then 7 divides Q - 7M*N=(M - N)^2 - 4*M*N=(alpha)^2 - (beta)^2, so that 7 always divides (alpha)*(beta)*(alpha^2 - beta^2). In a primitive Pythagorean triangle, 7 divides one of the legs or their sum or their difference.",
