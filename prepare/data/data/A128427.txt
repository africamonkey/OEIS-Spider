        "Denoting by x(n) the largest real root of (x-n)^n+...+(x-1)^n=x^N (so that by definition a(n)=floor(x(n))), it is conjectured (\"Cyprian's Last Theorem\") but not fully proved that x(n) is never an integer for n>3. A (very rapidly very good) asymptotic approximation to x(n) is 1.5 + n / ln2 + O(1/n), but this needs proof. This yields floor(1.5 + n / ln2) as an approximation to a(n)."
