        "Conjecture: The sequence is infinite.",
        "Subbarao & Yip prove that if there is an integer m such that the equation Phi_2(x) = m has a unique solution, where Phi_2 is the 2nd Schemmel totient function (A058026), then x == 0(mod a(n)^2) for each term in this sequence. They conjectured an analog to Carmichael's conjecture, that this equation has no unique solution to any integer m, and prove that any counter-example to this conjecture is > 10^120000, a bound calculated from the first 10000 terms of this sequence. A proof that this sequence is infinite would prove the conjecture. - _Amiram Eldar_, Mar 25 2017"
