        "We include \"1\" for the 1-dimensional trivial representation and we list each dimension once, ignoring the possibility that inequivalent representations may have the same dimension.",
        "Inequivalent representations can have the same dimension. For example, the highest weights 10100000 and 10000011 (with fundamental weights numbered as in Bourbaki) both correspond to irreducible representations of dimension 8634368000."
