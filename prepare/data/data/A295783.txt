        "a(n) is the number of distinct numerators that exist in row n of the Kepler tree A294442 but not yet in row n-1 of the tree (assuming a row count such that 1/1 is in row 0).",
        "It is the number of numerators that are \"new\" in row n (because the set of denominators of row n-1 contributes to the set of numerators of row n.)",
        "a(n) is nonnegative because A294443 is monotonously increasing (because all numerators of one row become numerators of the next row).",
        "Define the \"entry level\" E(j) as the smallest row number at which denominator j appears in A294442 (again: row counts start at 1/1 as row 0), then a(n+1) is the number of occurences of n in j: a(n+1) = #{j: E(j)=n}.",
        "It is likely that E(j) = A178047(j), verified for the first 10,000 terms."
