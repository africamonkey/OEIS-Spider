        "No formula known. However, the subset of solutions consisting of \"tiles\" with minimum edge lengths from a corner of the board to the center is A001700.",
        "This sequence can be computed by counting paths in a graph. To compute the n-th term a graph with n X (n-1) vertices is required. Each graph vertex corresponds to 4 intersections between grid lines on the chessboard and graph edges correspond to ways of cutting the board along the grid lines. Frontier (matrix-transfer) graph path counting methods can then be applied to the graph to get the actual count. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Apr 18 2016"
