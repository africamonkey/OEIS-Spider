        "The pseudo- or almost-palindromic numbers considered here are not related to the similarly named but different concepts mentioned in comments on A003555 and in A060087 - A060088.",
        "We could consider \"more general\" palindromic concatenations like A.B.B.A, A.B.C.B.A, etc... but all of these can be written as A.B'.A with B' = B.B resp. B.C.B, etc. The result is non palindromic (i.e., not in A002113) as required, if and only if at least one of the strings is non-palindromic.",
        "Here, A is allowed to have only one digit, so most of the first 100 terms are of the form 1.B.1 where B = 10, 12, 13, ... (palindromes 11, 22, 33... excluded).",
        "If all of the strings A, B (...) are required to be non-palindromic, the sequence starts with terms of the form A.A with A = 10, 12, 13, ..., 98:  1010, 1212, 1313, 1414, 1515, 1616, 1717, 1818, 1919, 2020, 2121, 2323, ....
