        "The length (number of decimal digits) of a(n) may be a power of 2 and often simply doubles, when n is increased by 1. But there are many exceptions: n = 11, 12, 13 give lengths 2^8, 3*2^7, 2^9, respectively. A factor of 3 is found in the lengths of a(n) for n = 12, 112..123, 1113..1234, 11123..12345, and so on. A factor of 7 is found for n = 1112, 11112..11122, and so on. 15 is factor of the length of a(11111112)."
