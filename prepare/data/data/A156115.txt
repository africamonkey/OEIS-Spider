        "Other sequences with 10 consecutive primes of this type of restricted gaps start at 1644607, 2214907, 2465909, 5714309, 8451407, 8468401 etc., so 367603 is not the only example. Their associated centuries 16447, 22150, 24660, 57144 etc. are put into A103608 iff they are prime. [From _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 20 2009, Mar 01 2009]"
