        "By the Euclid-Euler theorem, an even number n is perfect (A000396) if and only if n=2^(k-1)*(2^k-1), where 2^k-1 is prime. From this it follows that all even perfect numbers more than 6 have only odious divisors (A000069). In contrast to them, this sequence lists those abundant numbers n (A005101), all proper evil divisors of which sum to n.",
        "It is asked, are there non-perfect numbers n, all proper odious divisors of which sum to n? The first two such numbers were found by Giovanni Resta, see A212302."
