        "We can easily show that the sum of the first k^n primes is an even number for odd k. However, except for the first term, the last digit of these numbers is 6 or 8. What happened to 0 and 4? Similarly, there is no 4 ending for the known values of sums of the first 5^n primes. This is just an example of the Strong law of small numbers (R Guy). Indeed, the sum of the occurrences of any digit 0-9 in the sum of the first n prime numbers, A007504(n), approaches Pi(n)/10 as n -> infinity. For n = 10^6, Pi(n) = 78498 and the count of the last digit d in A007504(10^6) = d = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 count = 7919, 7963, 7808, 7840, 8000, 7759, 7778, 7878, 7744, 7809. While we probably will never know, a(n) will end in all even numbers in similar fashion as n-> infinity. Any guesses? Maybe there is an analytical way to prove this? a(12) will be forthcomming in a week or so."
