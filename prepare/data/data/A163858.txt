        "p-6 will be prime if the prime triple contains the last 3 primes of a sexy prime quadruple.",
        "There are two sexy prime triples classes, (-1, -1, -1) (mod 6) and (+1, +1, +1) (mod 6). They should asymptotically have the same number of triples, if there is an infinity of such triples, although with a Chebyshev bias expected against the quadratic residue class triples (+1, +1, +1) (mod 6), which doesn't affect the asymptotic result. This sequence counts both classes.",
        "Also the sexy prime triples of class (-1, -1, -1) (mod 6) fall within (11, 17, 23, 29) (mod 30) while the sexy prime triples of class (+1, +1, +1) (mod 6) fall within (1, 7, 13, 19) (mod 30)."
