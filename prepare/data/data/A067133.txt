    "comment": [
        "The sequence consists of primes, powers of 2 and 6. Sketch of proof: Let k be the common difference of the arithmetic progression. If n is odd, then 1 and 2 are coprime to n, so k=1 and n is prime. If n==0 (mod 4), then n/2-1 and n/2+1 are coprime to n, so k=2 and n is a power of 2. If n==2 (mod 4), then n/2-2 and n/2+2 are coprime to n, so k divides 4 and n is either 2 or 6."
