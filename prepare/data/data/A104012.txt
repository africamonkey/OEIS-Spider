        "Because the cubic polynomial for centered dodecahedral numbers factors into n time an irreducible quadratic, the dodecahedral numbers can never be prime, but can be semiprime iff (2*n+1) is prime and (5*n^2+5*n+1) is prime. Centered dodecahedral numbers (A005904) are not to be confused with dodecahedral numbers (A006566) = n(3n-1)(3n-2)/2, nor with rhombic dodecahedral numbers (A005917).",
