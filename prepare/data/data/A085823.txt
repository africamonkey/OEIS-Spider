        "A more general definition is \"Numbers such that all substrings of length <= 3 are primes\". Proof: For numbers < 1000 this is plainly true. Suppose that there are such n >= 1000. We recognize that n must contain the string 373, as this is the only valid prime substring with the length 3. It follows, that there are substrings x37 or 73x, with any digit x. Evidently, neither x37 nor 73x are valid prime substrings, independent from the digit x. Thus, there is no number >= 1000 such that all substrings of length <= 3 are primes.",
        "Also, numbers such that all substrings of length <= 2 are primes and the number of prime substrings of length = 3 is greater than m-3 for n <= 37373 and is greater than min(m-4,floor((m-1)/2) else; where m=floor(log_10(a(n)))+1 = number of digits. (End)"
