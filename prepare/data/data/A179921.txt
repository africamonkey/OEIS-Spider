        "Using Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, it is easy to prove that the sequence is infinite.  The sequence of the corresponding denominators begins with 2,1,3,5,4,11,7,6,17, ..."

        "The first four terms 2,3,5,13 give three denominators: 2,1,3. Then a(5) is not in {17, 19}, since (13-5)/(17-13) = 2/1, (13-5)/(19-13) = 4/3 and denominators 1 and 3 already appeared earlier. Since (13-5)/(23-13) = 4/5 and 5 is not yet in the denominator sequence, a(5) = 23."
