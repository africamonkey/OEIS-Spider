    "comment": [
        "Here we refer to anomalous cancellation in a fraction if numerator and denominator have one or more digits in common, and the value of the fraction remains the same if all pairs of common digits are \"cancelled\", i.e., removed. (There are other variants of this definition, e.g., A291094, which differ in particular when there is more than one pair of common digits.)",
        "For any solution one could add a trailing 0 to numerator and denominator and get another solution, but such solutions are excluded here.",
        "See A291966 for the numerators. See the variant A291094 for other references.",
        "The fractions are assumed to be between 0 and 1."
