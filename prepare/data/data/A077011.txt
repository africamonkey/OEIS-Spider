        "When parsed in blocks of ascending length, as shown in the example, there is the following interpretation: The integers Z regarded as a module over themselves contains unshortenable generating sets of different lengths, in fact, infinitely many of each desired length. Each of the blocks is the minimal example of an unshortenable generating set of the respective length. For example, {6,10,15} generates Z as 1=6+10-15. However, removing one of the numbers leaves two numbers that are not relatively prime, precluding generation of Z. An analogous argument succeeds for all other blocks alike. Each block contains numbers such that there is no prime factor common to all. Taking differences sufficiently often one ends up with two coprime numbers whence the generating property follows from Bezout's theorem. Removing just one number from the set, relative primality is lost. The minimality of the numbers used in each block is evident from the construction. - Peter C.
