        "Amounts in cents of coins in denominations 1, 5 and 10 cents that must include change for a 25-cent coin. Regarding currently-minted US coins, note that the 25-cent quarter is the only denomination for which a smaller denomination exists (the 10-cent dime) which is not a divisor. As a result, an amount that may consist only of any number of dimes and up to four 1-cent pennies does not guarantee change for a quarter."
