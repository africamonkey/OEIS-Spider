        "Also set of all n>=0, excluding 3, for which n+1 is composite. [Proof: (i) If n+1 is prime, there cannot be any factor in n! to cancel the n+1 in the denominator of the expression. (ii) If n+1=composite=a*b, a<b, consider the equivalent expression (n+1)!/(n+1)^2=1*2*..*a*..*b*..(a*b)/(a^2*b^2) in which factors obviously cancel. (iii) If n+1=square=a^2, a>2, (n+1)!/(n+1)^2 = 1*2*..*a*...*(2a)*..*a^2/a^4 in which factors also cancel.] - _R. J. Mathar_, Nov 22 2006"
