    "example": [
        "The first term, 1, is associated to the usual construction of the torus: identify opposite sides of a square. The 1-vertex triangulation is obtained by subdividing the square into 2 triangles along a diagonal. Another point of view is to identify opposite sides of a hexagon (thus getting a torus). The 1-vertex triangulation is the dual of the boundary of the hexagon (which is a graph having 2 nodes and a triple edge between them) drawn on the torus."
