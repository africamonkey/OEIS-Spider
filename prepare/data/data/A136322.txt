        "Previous definition: Call an integer m >= 1 plentiful iff the square of m has twice as many bits (floor log_2 plus one) as m. For each n >= 1 there is a unique k >= 0 so that an m with 2^n <= m < 2^(n+1) is plentiful iff m >= 2^n+k. a(n) is this k.",
        "This sequence has a geometric interpretation. Let 2^(n+1) be the length of the fixed base of all integer isosceles triangles whose equal sides are shorter than its base. Then a(n) is the number of these isosceles triangles whose height above the base is < 2^n. It includes the degenerate isosceles triangle of height 0.  - _Frank M Jackson_, Sep 16 2017"
