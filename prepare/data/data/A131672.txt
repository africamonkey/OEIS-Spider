        "Moree's abstract: \"Let Psi_n(x) be the monic polynomial having precisely all nonprimitive n-th roots of unity as its simple zeros. One has Psi_n(x)=(x^n-1)/Phi_n(x), with Phi_n(x) the n-th cyclotomic polynomial. The coefficients of Psi_n(x) are integers that like the coefficients of Phi_n(x) tend to be surprisingly small in absolute value, e.g. for n<561 all coefficients of $Psi_n(x) are <= 1 in absolute value. We establish various properties of the coefficients of Psi_n(x)."
