In other words, semiprimes whose both prime factors do not fit (simultaneously) between any two consecutive powers of any natural number r less than or equal to the larger prime factor. This condition forces the larger prime factor q to be greater than the square of the smaller prime factor because otherwise the opposite condition given in A251728 would hold.",
