        "This formula was derived from the x-th root formula 1/(x^(1/x) - 1)+ 1/2 and the well known approximation Pi(x) ~ x/(log(x) - 1). If x = 2^n, the formula can be evaluated by repeated square roots avoiding logs.",
        "For little googol = 2^100 the formula gives 18556039405581571438895944827, while Riemann's R(x) = 18560140176092446446103729058.",
        "The formula is much more accurate than x/log(x) and for small x, Legendre's constant 1.08366 can be used for the 1/x term as 1.08366/x. This is more accurate for small x. However, for large x, the more noble formula 1/(x^(1/x) - 1/x - 1) is superior."
