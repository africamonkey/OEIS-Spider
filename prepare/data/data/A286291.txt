Carrying on we get 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 12 isn't in the sequence. Further in the sequence, 30 is in the sequence though it's of the form k*(k+1) for k = 5. But 6 isn't in the sequence. And indeed, 5 and 7 are consecutive terms so 5*7 = 35 isn't in the sequence. - _David A. Corneth_, May 25 2017"
