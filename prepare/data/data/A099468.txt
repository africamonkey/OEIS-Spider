        "No others < 10^8. Note that 3 divides all these n > 1. This sequence is conjectured to be complete. Related to a question posed in A036468 by Zhang Ming-Zhi. Let r=2s+1 be an odd number. If n = (s+1)^2+s^2, then the sequence m(0)=n, m(k+1)=m(k)+4k for k=0,1,...s calculates the s+1 distinct sums of two squares (r-i)^2+i^2."
