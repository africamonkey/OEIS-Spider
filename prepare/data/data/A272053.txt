        "Let ABC be a lattice triangle in an n X n grid. If ABC is scalene, then the pairs (BA,AC), (AB,BC), and (AC, CB) form three inequivalent polygonal chains; likewise, if ABC is isosceles and AB is the base of the triangle, then (BA,AC) and (AC,CB) form two distinct polygonal chains, while (BC,CA) is congruent to (AB,BC).",
        "Now consider an arbitrary 2-segment polygonal chain (XY,YZ). By the side-angle-side criterion for triangle congruence, the triangle to which XY and YZ belong is determined up to congruence, and so the proposed formula does not over-count. Thus a(n) = 3*A190313(n) + 2*A189978(n)."
