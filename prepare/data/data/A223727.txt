        "A primitive representation of a number m as a sum of four distinct nonzero squares is determined from a quadruple [s(1), s(2), s(3), s(4)] of integers with 0 < s(1) < s(2) < s(3) < s(4) with gcd(s(1),s(2),s(3),s(4)) = 1, and m = sum(s(j)^2, j=1..4). If m has such a primitive representation then k^2*m, with integer k > 0, has trivially a non-primitive representation. Therefore primitive representations are of interest.",
