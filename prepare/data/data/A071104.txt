        "The graph consists of the vertices (x,y) excluding (0,0) bounded by |x|<=k, |y|<=k, |x+y|<=k and |x-y|<=k+1 where k=2n+1. Vertices (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are adjacent iff |x1-x2|=1 and y1=y2 or x1=x2 and |y1-y2|=1 or |x1-x2|=|y1-y2|=1 and x1+y1 is odd. The graph is planar and has 8*n^2 + 16*n + 6 vertices. Figure 13 in the J. Propp reference shows the graph for n=1.  - _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 07 2016"
