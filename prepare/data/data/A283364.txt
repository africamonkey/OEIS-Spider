        "If a(n) is odd, then 2^a(n)+1 is divisible by 3, so (2^a(n)+1)/3 should be prime or a power of prime. So in the case of a(n)=p*q, also (2^(p*q)+1)/3 should be prime or a power of prime. Since 2^p*q+1 is divisible by both 2^p+1 and 2^q+1, then it is impossible at least for 3<p<q. In case a(n)=3*p, where p is prime >=5, 2^(3*p)+1 divisible by 3,2^p+1 and 2^(3*p)+1 which all containing at least 3 distinct primes; analogously in case a(n)=p^2, p>=5, the number 2^(p^2)+1 has more than 2 distinct primes.",
        "Add that there are no even a(n) except for 2,4 and 6, since, for p>=5, 2^(2*p)-1 has at least 3 distinct prime factors, and in case n=2^k, k>=3, 2^n-1 has also at least 3 distinct prime factors.",
        "So we conclude that all terms a(n)>9 are prime."
