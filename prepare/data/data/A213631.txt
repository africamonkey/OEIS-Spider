        "It is easily checked that for m=(p+p')/2 (average between two consecutive primes), the numbers m +/- 1 resp. m +/- 2 resp.  m +/- 3 (as well as m +/- 6) are (in each case) either both prime, either both composite (for p>7). Thus, m +/- 4 provides the least counter-example to this behavior, and the primes listed here are those for which the property does not hold, i.e., one among { m-4, m+4 } is prime and the other one is composite."
