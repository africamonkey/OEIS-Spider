        "a(n) is bounded above by the sequence A038623, in which k is required to be prime. In addition, the sequence pi(a(n)) = {1, 4, 9, 30, 67, 180, 437, 1051, ...} closely resembles the sequence A038624, in which the n-th term is the minimal t such that k >= n * pi(k) for every k satisfying pi(k) = t. If we were to make the inequality in A038624 strict, the resulting sequence would provide an upper bound for pi(a(n)). Sequences A038625, A038626 and A038627 focus on the equality k = n * pi(k): as we would expect, a(n) follows A038625 very closely for large n."
