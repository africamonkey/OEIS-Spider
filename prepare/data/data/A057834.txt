        "Legendre's Logarithmic Law: \"In 1896, a full century after Adrienne Marie Legendre (1752 - 1833) guessed the approximate formula N/ln N for the number of primes up to N, Jacques Hadamard and Charles-Jacques de la Vallee-Poussin conclusively established it. They both lived for more than 50 years after producing their simultaneous but independent proofs.\" ... \"In the meantime, Gauss and Riemann had made improved guesses expressed in terms of natural logarithms that we'll meet in Chapter 9.\""
