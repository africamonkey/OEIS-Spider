        "This sequence is infinite: Ribenboim states that Rieger proved in 1969 that \"there exist infinitely many primes p such that p^2 - 2 [is an element of] P_5\", this being a particular case of a general theorem proved (also in 1969) by Richert: (again quoting Ribenboim) \"Let f(X) be a polynomial with integral coefficients, positive leading coefficient, degree d >= 1 (and different from X). Assume that for every prime p, the number [rho](p) of solutions of f(X) = 0 (mod p) is less than p; moreover if p <= d+1 and p does not divide f(0) assume also that [rho](p) < p-1. Then, there exist infinitely many primes p such that f(p) is a (2d+1)-almost prime.\""
