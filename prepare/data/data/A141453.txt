If n=2 then, besides r(3) = 5, also sqrt(3*2^(2+2) + 1) = 7 is an incongruent solution mod 12 if the exponent 2 is chosen.

If n=1 there are altogether two incongruent solutions, namely 1 and r(2) = 3 = 4-1 (a trivial solution == -1 (mod 4)). For n>=3 there are eight incongruent solutions, and besides the trivial (positive) ones, 1 and a(n)*2^(k(n)+1) - 1, one has a nontrivial pair r(a(n)) and a(n)*2^(k(n)+1) - r(a(n)).
