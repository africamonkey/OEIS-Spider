    "comment": [
        "The standard way to search for records in the ABC conjecture is to run with the C parameter through all the integers A000027. If this search space is diluted by admitting only powers of 2 as in A147639, the sequence of records changes. This sequence here lists the B such that the triples (A=A147640(n),B=a(n),C=A147639(n)) locate records for this search restricting C to powers of 2."
