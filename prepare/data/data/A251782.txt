        "37 is the first irregular prime. The corresponding entry for the second irregular prime 59 is A299466, and for the third irregular prime 67 is A299467.",
        "The p-adic digits of the unique simple zero of the p-adic zeta function zeta_{(p,l)} with (p,l)=(37,32) were used to compute the sequence (see the Mathematica program below). This corresponds with Table A.2 in Kellner (2007). The sequence is increasing, but some consecutive entries are identical, e.g., entries 18 / 19 and 80 / 81. This is caused only by those p-adic digits that are zero."
