        "The ratio of lower Beatty terms to upper tends to k = e^G. This can be confirmed by examining the continued fraction convergents to 1/k = 0.561459484..., the first few being 1/1, 1/2, 4/7, 5/9, 9/16, 32/57, ... Check: 32/57 = 0.562403508... Let a convergent = a/b. Through n = (a+b) = 14, 9 terms are in the lower Beatty pair set and 5 are in the upper (2, 5, 8, 11, 13).",
