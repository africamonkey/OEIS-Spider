        "Previous name was: \"For each term in this sequence, n say, consider the fraction of square numbers between 1 & n, inclusive, when reduced to its lowest terms. This fraction will always have a numerator of 2 for numbers in this sequence\".",
        "To obtain similar fractions as above with a numerator of 1, for example 1/5 are square, there are three possible numbers, namely 15, 20, 25. In general it is fairly easy to show that for 1/k of the numbers up to n (1 to n inclusive) to be square, n takes one of the three values, k(k-2), k(k-1), k^2. This sequence looks at obtaining fractions of the form 2/k. Another sequence (A153194) looks at the 3/k case.",
