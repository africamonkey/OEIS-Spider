        "Every term in the sequence is composite (since the only proper divisor of a prime is 1). The sum of the proper divisors of a k-digit composite number n must exceed sqrt(n) >= sqrt(10^(k-1)), but the square of the sum of the digits of a k-digit number cannot exceed (9k)^2 = 81k^2. Since sqrt(10^(k-1)) > 81k^2 for all integers k > 8, every term in the sequence must be less than the smallest 9-digit number, 10^8. An exhaustive search through 10^8 shows that a(25)=699359 is the last term. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Dec 13 2016"
