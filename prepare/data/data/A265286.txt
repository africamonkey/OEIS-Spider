        "An equivalent formulation in terms of integers: after multiplying by the LCM of the denominators, a(n) is the minimal cardinality M of a multiset S of positive integers which can be partitioned into k multisets with equal sums for all k = 1, ..., n.",
        "A subsidiary problem: Look at all the multisets S for a given value of n that have M = a(n) elements, and let g(n) denote the minimal value of the largest element of any such S. The initial values of g(n) for n=1..6 are 1, 1, 2, 3, 12, 10, which suggests that g(n) might equal A002944(n) = LCM{1..n}/n. Multisets associated with these values of g(n) are {1}, {1,1}, {1,1,2,2}, {1,1,1,3,3,3}, {1,2,3,5,7,8,10,12,12}, {2,2,3,4,4,5,5,7,8,10,10}. - _Max Alekseyev_ and _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 25 2016",

        "We could also ask about the smallest piece in any of the multisets S. For n=6, the minimum smallest piece in an 11-piece solution is 1/120, as in [1/120, 1/40, 1/30, 7/120, 3/40, 11/120, 13/120, 1/8, 17/120, 1/6, 1/6].
