        "I introduce this sequence which is A128913(n)/2 because it is closely related to the prime counting function Pi(n) and the sum of primes < n for large n.",

The sum of primes < 10^20 = 109778913483063648128485839045703833541. The error here is -0.01149... It converges quite slowly and better approximations have been found.",
        "This relationship was derived by using the summation formula for an arithmetic progression. For the odd integers where n is even, let the first term = 1, the last term is n-1 and the number of terms is n/2. So the sum of the odd numbers < n is ((1 +n-1)*n/2)/2. If we let Pi(x) be the number of terms, we get the result n*Pi(n)/2. A closed formula, SumP(n) ~ n^2/(2*log(n)-1) is quite accurate. The best formula I have found is the remarkable SumP(n) ~ Pi(n^2).",
