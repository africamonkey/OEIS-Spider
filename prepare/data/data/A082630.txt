        "Let alpha be an algebraic integer and define a sequence of integers a(alpha,n) by the condition a(alpha,n) = max { integer d : alpha^n = = 1 (mod d)}. Silverman shows that a(alpha,n) is a strong-divisibility sequence, that is gcd(a(n), a(m)) = a(gcd(n, m)) for all  n and m in N; in particular, if n divides m then a(n) divides a(m). This sequence appears to be the strong divisibility sequence a(2 + sqrt(3),n) (Silverman, Example 4). - _Peter Bala_, Jan 10 2014"
