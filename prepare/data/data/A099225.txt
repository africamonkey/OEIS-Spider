        "For n=11, there are two representations: 2^3+3 and 3^2+2. All other numbers < 10^16 of this form have a unique representation. The uniqueness question leads to a Pillai-like exponential Diophantine equation a^x-b^y = y-x for y > x > 1 and b > a > 1, which appears to have only one solution."
