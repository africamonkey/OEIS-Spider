        "The sequence of generalized tribonacci numbers is defined as beginning with 1, 3, 7. Subsequent terms are the sum of the previous three terms. Note that the sequence of these generalized tribonacci numbers has many more primes than the tribonacci sequence A000073 (whose prime indices are in A092835).",
