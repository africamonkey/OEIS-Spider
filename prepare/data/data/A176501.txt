        "This sequence arises in the analytically obtained strict upper bound of the set of equivalent resistances formed by any conceivable network (series/parallel or bridge, or non-planar) of n equal resistors. Consequently it provides an strict upper bound of the sequences: A048211, A153588, A174283, A174284, A174285 and A174286. This strict upper bound provided by this difficult to compute (due to computer memory) sequence is better than the easier to compute Sequence A176499."
