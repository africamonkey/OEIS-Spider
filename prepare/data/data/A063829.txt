        "The sequence includes all numbers of the form 6 * p^2 with p a prime >= 5. All of the terms above are of this form, except for 1428. There are similar subsequences corresponding to each of the five known unitary perfect numbers (A002827), namely 60 * p^9 (p>=7), 90 * p^14 (p>=7), 87360 * p^1559 (p=11 or p>=17) and 146361946186458562560000 * p^3009086064688703999 (p>=17 and not equal to 19, 37, 79, 109, 157, or 313). It is not known if there are other terms in the sequence besides these and 1428. - _Dean Hickerson_",
