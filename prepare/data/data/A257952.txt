        "Number of ways to dissect a 2n X 2n chessboard into 4 congruent pieces. As stated by Thomas R. Parkin in his letter (see Links), the dissections belong to two classes. One in which the cuts divide the chessboard into four pieces  which are 90 degrees rotationally symmetric, the other in which the square is first bisected in two rectangles and then each rectangle is divided into two pieces which are 180 degrees rotationally symmetric.",
        "Two dissections are considered distinct if they belong to two different classes, even if the tile is the same. In both classes reflections and rotations are not counted, and moreover in the second class two dissections are considered the same if they differ only by the orientation of the tiles."
