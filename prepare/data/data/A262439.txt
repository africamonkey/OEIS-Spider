        "Conjecture: (i) The sequence is strictly increasing, and also a(n)^(1/n) >  a(n+1)^(1/(n+1)) for all n = 3,4,....",
        "(ii) The sequence is an addition chain. In other words, for each n = 2,3,... we have a(n) = a(k) + a(m) for some 0 < k <= m < n.",
        "(iii) All the numbers sum_{i=j,...,k} 1/a(i) with 0 < min{2,k} <= j <= k have pairwise distinct fractional parts.",
