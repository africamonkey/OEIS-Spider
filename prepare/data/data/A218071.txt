    "comment": [
        "This is a peripheral spin-off sequence--the 4th in a set--to a collection dealing with a complex of coincidences concerning interbase translation (the substitution of digits from the representation of a number in one base to another, essentially number-->polynomial-->number). The word 'extended' is in the title to distinguish between the more usual case of such translations being done from a smaller to a larger base and the opposite case where the digital substitution can only be generally done formally because of digits being greater than or equal to the second base.  See cross-referenced sequences for the initiating material. The entries here answer the question of which bases take a certain prime to a prime below that base."
