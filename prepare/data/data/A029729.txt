        "Also, ratio of vector elements of the ground state in the loop representation of the braid-monoid Hamiltonian H = Sum_i (3 - 2 e_i - b_i) with size 2n and periodic boundary conditions. Specifically the smallest element that corresponds to a non-crossing chord diagram, divided by the overall smallest element. We reduce the standard braid-monoid algebra to the Brauer algebra B_{2n}(1). - B. Nienhuis & J. de Gier (B.Nienhuis(AT)UvA.NL), May 13 2004. For a proof that this is the same sequence, see the articles by P. Di Francesco and P. Zinn-Justin and A. Knutson and P. Zinn-Justin.",
