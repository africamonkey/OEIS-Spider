        "Or, given such a partition P of n, let T(P) = sum_i p_i^2; then a(n) = number of integers that are a T(P) for some P. While T(P) need not equal S(P) for a given partition, the two sets of integers are equal. Or, expand the infinite product prod_k 1/(1-x^{k^2}y^k) as a power series; then a(n) = number of terms of the form x^my^n having a nonzero coefficient.",
