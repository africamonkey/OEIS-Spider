        "The sequence starts with 1000000079994144385 (the 19-digit number discovered by Vaughn Suite on Jul 26 2005 and rediscovered by Jason Doucette on Nov 28 2005) and continues for another 224 terms (none previously reported) each turning into a 119-digit palindrome after 259 steps until the sequence ends with 1000004999700144385. The distance between successive terms in the reported sequence has 9000000 as the greatest common divisor. No further numbers beyond 1000004999700144385 belonging to the same sequence are known, discovered or reported. The sequence was found empirically using computer modeling algorithms.",
        "The sequence was extended to 1620000 terms in total and currently ends with 6834414999700000000 (see a-file). The sequence is complete - no further numbers beyond 6834414999700000000 belonging to the same sequence exist. The sequence was predicted theoretically and found empirically using computer modeling algorithms. - _Sergei D. Shchebetov_, May 12 2017"
