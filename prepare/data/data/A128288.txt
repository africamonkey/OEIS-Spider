        "3 divides A023163(n) for n>1. A023163(n) are the numbers n such that Fib(n) == -2 (mod n). Almost all terms of a(n) are prime that belong to A003631 = {2, 3, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, 47, 53, 67, 73, 83, 97} Primes congruent to {2, 3} mod 5; that are also the primes p that divide Fibonacci(p+1). The first composite term is a(74) = 1853 = 17*109. The second composite term is 9701 = 89*109. The third composite term is 10877 = 73*149 belong to A069107(n) Composite n such that n divides F(n+1) where F(k) are the Fibonacci numbers. Composite terms in a(n) are listed in A128289 = {1853, 9701, 10877, 17261, ...}."
