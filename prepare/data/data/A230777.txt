        "These indices are ranks of prime numbers; corresponding primes are in A230778, and corresponding record values are in A230776.",
        "A228098(n) is the number of primes p > prime(n) and such that p*prime(n) < prime(n+1)^2. This value is related to the distribution of primes around prime(n+1). High values correspond to a large gap before prime(n+1) followed by several small gaps after prime(n+1).",
        "There is no value > 14 in the 100000 first terms of A228098, and only one equals to 14: A228098(31545), which corresponds to prime(31545) = 370261."
