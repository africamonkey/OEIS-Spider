        "A roller coaster is a pattern in a permutation (not necessarily consecutive) consisting of alternating up and down steps, with always at least two in one direction.",

        "- 123 and 321 are the only two (maximal) roller coasters in all permutations with 3 elements; see also the examples section. These patterns are the smallest two roller coasters that exist.",
        "- The permutation 1536742 contains the maximal roller coasters 136742, 156742 and 532, no further maximal roller coaster.",

        "- The permutation 1254367 is already a roller coaster, so the only maximal roller coaster is the permutation itself."
