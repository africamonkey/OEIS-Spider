        "In more detail, the sequence is constructed as follows: Start with a(1) = 0. The missing numbers are 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... Add the first two, and we get 3, which is therefore a(2). Cross 1, 2, and 1+2=3 off the missing list. The first two missing numbers are now 4 and 5, so a(3) = 4+5 = 9. Cross off 4,5,9 from the missing list. Repeat.",
        "In other words, this is the sum of consecutive pairs in the sequence 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, ..., (A249031) the complement to the present one in the natural numbers. For example, a(1)=1+2=3, a(2)=4+5=9, a(3)=6+7=13, ... - Philippe Lallouet (philip.lallouet(AT)orange.fr), May 08 2008",
