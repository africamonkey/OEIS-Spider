        "This sequence was generated by adding 12 Fibonacci-like sequences [See: PROG?]. Looking at the format 90n+89 modulo 9 and modulo 10 we see that all entries of A142335 have digital root 8 and last digit 9. (Reverting the process is an application of the Chinese remainder theorem.) The 12 Fibonacci-like sequences are generated (via the p and q \"seed\" values entered into the PERL program) from the base p,q pairs 89*91, 19*71, 37*17, 73*53, 11*49, 29*31, 47*67, 83*13, 23*43, 41*79, 59*61, 77*7."
