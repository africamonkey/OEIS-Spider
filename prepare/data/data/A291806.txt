        "The sequence gives the number of distinct tilings by polyominoes of a square with side n. As for \"free\" polyominoes, tilings that are reflections or rotations of each other are not considered distinct.",
        "Using the same terminology used for polyominoes: the corresponding sequence for \"fixed\" tilings is 1,12,1434,1691690, and for one-sided tilings is 1,5,222,213315."
