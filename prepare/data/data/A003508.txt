        "R. K. Guy reports, Apr 14 2005: In Math. Mag. 48 (1975) 301 one finds \"C. W. Trigg, C. C. Oursler and R. Cormier & J. L. Selfridge have sent calculations on Problem 886 [Nov 1973] for which we had received only partial results [Jan 1975]. Cormier and Selfridge sent the following results: There appear to be five sequences beginning with integers less than 1000 which do not merge. These sequences were carried out to 10^8 or more.\" The five sequences are A003508, A105210-A105213.",
        "This suggests that there may be infinitely many different (non-merging) sequences obtained by choosing different starting values.",
