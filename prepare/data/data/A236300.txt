(iib) If the u, v, w are distinct >= 1 then the even members of the sequence A004432 with multiplicities A025442 are of interest. But only those (u, v, w) qualify which satisfy u - v + w = 0. E.g., A025442(5) = 30 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 does not qualify because no permutation of 1, 2, 5 works for u, v, w. A025442(1) = 14 qualifies because (u, v, w) = (2, 3, 1) satisfies 2 - 3 + 1 = 0.
