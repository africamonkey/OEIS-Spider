        "A very restricted form of the prime circle problem whose sequence is A051252. This sequence lists the n for which A072617(n) is positive. See A072616 for the case where only the odd numbers or only the even numbers are in order.",
        "There is a provable solution for n when either (a) 2n+1 and 2n+3 are prime, (b) 2k+1, 2k+3, 2k+2n+1 and 2k+2n+3 are prime for some 0 < k < n-1, or (c) 2n-1, 2n+1 and 4n-1 are primes. Part (a) is due to Mike Hennebry. Note that cases (a) and (b) involve 3 sets of twin primes. For n > 3, due to the form of twin primes, it can be shown that (a) implies not (b) and not (c)."
