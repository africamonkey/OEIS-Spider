        "No number occurs more than once in the sequence because if a(n)=m then if m occurs again then a(n)*m=m^2. a(n) is always bigger than a(n-1) because all numbers less than a(n-1) have been checked to see if they make a square and if any do then because of the uniqueness of each value of a(n) then they must have already occurred in the sequence previously."
