        "All visible sequence terms give exactly 3 prime factors. The smallest composite of the form p(n)=n^2+n+41 with 4 prime factors occurs for p(1721)=2963603=43*41^3. Smallest n with 4 distinct prime factors: p(2911)=8476873=83*53*47*41, smallest n with 5 prime factors: p(14144)=200066921=47^4*41, smallest n with 5 distinct prime factors: p(38913)=1514260523=173*71*61*47*43."
