        "In their abstract, Luca and Shparlinski write: \"In this note, we show that if we write floor(e*n!) = s(n)*u(n)^2, where s(n) is square-free then S(N) = prod(n<=N) has at least C log log N distinct prime factors for some absolute constant C > 0 and sufficiently large N.  A similar result is obtained for the total number of distinct primes dividing the m-th power-free part of s(n) as n ranges from 1 to N, where m = 3 is a positive integer. As an application of such results, we give an upper bound on the number of n <= N such that floor(e*n!) is a square.\""
