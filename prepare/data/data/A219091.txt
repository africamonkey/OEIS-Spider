        "a(n) is the number k such that {k^p} < 1/2 < {(k+1)^p}, where p = 1/8 and { } = fractional part.  Equivalently, the jump sequence of f(x) = x^(1/8), in the sense that these are the nonnegative integers k for which round(k^p) < round((k+1)^p).  It appears that the sequence is linearly recurrent with order 23.  Compare its signature with row 9 of the triangle at A008949.  For which values of p is there a match of this sort between the jump sequence of x^p and row p+1 of the triangle?",
