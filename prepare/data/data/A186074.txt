        "The sum from one set of digits to the following set of digits equals the term.  The first is the 5th triangular number: 15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.",
        "These are the positive integer solutions for the formula sum (x to y) = (10^k)*x + y, where 0 < x < y < 10^k for some k>=1.",
        "On the left hand side of this equation, the sum can be written as A000217(y) - A000217(x-1) = (x+y)*(1-x+y)/2, and the right hand side is the concatenation of the decimal digits of x and y.",
        "The graph of the function is a hyperbola; the solutions are for positive x and y, where y does not \"overlap\" and add to x.  The first 21 terms are all of the solutions for n = 1 to 4. n = 5 solutions add two 9-digit and six 10-digit terms.",
        "Note the pattern 1353 = sum (13 to 53); 133533 = sum (133 to 533); 13335333 = sum (1333 to 5333). This pattern continues: 1333353333 = sum (13333 to 53333); 133333533333 = sum (133333 to 533333); etc.  These are not the next terms in the sequence, however.",
