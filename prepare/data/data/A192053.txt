    "comment": [
        "Consider the \"shuffle\": start with p[i]=i for i in 1..n.  Then, for i in 1..n, pick j uniformly at random from 1..n, and swap p[i] and p[j].",
        "This \"shuffle\" results in a very non-uniform distribution.",
        "The probability of each permutation will be divisible by n^n (because there are n^n possible choices for the random draws).",
        "Empirically the most likely permutation is 2,3,...,[n/2],1,[n/2]+2,[n/2]+3,...,n,[n/2]+1, with probability a(n)/n^n.  For n odd, taking [n/2] = (n-1)/2 or (n+1)/2 results in two equally likely permutations.",
        "Empirically the least likely permutation is n,1,2,...n-1, with probability 2^(n-1)/n^n."
    ],
    "example": [
        "The sequence of random j values chosen determines the permutation.  For example, for n=3, the sequence j=3,1,3 results in swap(p[1],p[3]), swap(p[2],p[1]), swap(p[3],p[3]), and hence in permutation 2,3,1.",
        "For n=3, permutations arise from sequences of j as follows:",
