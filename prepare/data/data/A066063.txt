        "If one counts all subsets S of T={0,1,2,...n} such that each number in T is the sum of two elements of S, sequence A066062 is obtained.",
        "Since each k-subset of S covers at most binom(k + 1, 2) members of T, we have binom(A066063(n) + 1, 2) >= n + 1. It follows that A002024(n-1) is a lower bound. - _Rob Pratt_, May 14 2004",
        "This is an instance of the <= 2-stamp postage problem with n denominations. For n > 0, A066063(n) = 1 + the smallest i such that A001212(i) >= n (adding one adjusts for the fact that A001212 has offset 1). - Tim Peters (tim.one(AT)comcast.net), Aug 25 2006"
