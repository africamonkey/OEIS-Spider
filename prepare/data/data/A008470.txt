        "The decade m must be of the form 3k+1, since for m=3k, 10m+3 and 10m+9 cannot be prime and for m=3k+2, 10k+1 and 10k+7 cannot be prime. See A238713 for the least member of the triplet, i.e., the first prime of the corresponding decade.",
        "The first occurrence of 5 consecutive triplets is: 11, 13, 17 (or 19) ; 41, 43, 47 ; 71, 73, 79 ; 101, 103, 107 (or 109) ; 131, 137, 139. This corresponds to decades 1,4,7,10,13; i.e., the first 5 terms of this sequence. The next occurrence of 4 consecutive triples starts with decade m=541, and the next occurrence of 5 consecutive triples starts with decade m=910052463685 (found by J. K. Andersen). (End)"
