        "Bernardi-Fusy, p. 10: A d-angulation is a planar map with faces of degree d. We present for each integer d >= 3 a bijection between the class of d-angulations of girth d and a class of decorated plane trees. Each of the bijections is obtained by specializing a \"master bijection\" which extends an earlier construction of the first author. Bijections already existed for triangulations (d=3) and for quadrangulations (d=4). As a matter of fact, our construction unifies a bijection by Fusy, Poulalhon and Schaeffer for triangulations and a bijection by Schaeffer for quadrangulations.",
        "For d >= 5, both the bijections and the enumerative results are new. We also extend our bijections so as to enumerate p-gonal d-angulations, that is, d-angulations with a simple boundary of length p. We thereby recover bijectively the results of Brown for p-gonal triangulations and quadrangulations and establish new results for d >= 5."
