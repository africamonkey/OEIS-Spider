        "Conjecture: the second differences give A007503(n+1), the sum of the divisors (A000203) plus the number of divisors (A000005) of n+1.",
        "The first differences trivially are the total length of such sequences that end in n+1. Mapping each sequence to a different sequence by adding 1 to each term, we see that the second differences are the number of sequences up to n+2 that include both 1 and n+2. For each divisor d of n+1, there is a single such sequence of length d+1 (with increment (n+1)/d). The second difference is then sum_{d|n+1} d+1, which is sigma(n+1) + tau(n+1), as claimed. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Nov 05 2015"
