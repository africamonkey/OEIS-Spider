        "n such that A002378(n)=n*(n+1) is deficient.",
        "\"In 1700, Charles de Neuveglise claimed the product of two consecutive integers n(n+1) with n>=3 is abundant.\" -Tattersall, p. 144.  In other words de Neuveglise claimed that all oblong numbers greater than 6 are abundant.  In fact up to O(1100) 17.6% of the oblong numbers are deficient.  The per 100 count of deficient oblong numbers from O(1) to O(1100) is 16, 19, 19, 16, 17, 20, 18, 17, 17, 15, 20. For most deficient oblong numbers in this range either n or n+1 is prime but this is not always the case, explaining why the density of deficient oblong numbers does not decrease in line with the primes."
