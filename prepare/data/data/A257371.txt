    "comment": [
        "Here by \"DFA\" we mean \"deterministic finite automaton\", and by P_n^* we mean the set of all binary strings that can be formed as the concatenation of 0 or more of the base-2 representations of the first n primes.  The DFA must be \"complete\" (there must be a transition for each state and symbol) and hence includes any \"dead state\"."
