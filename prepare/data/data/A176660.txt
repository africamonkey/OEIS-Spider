        "Partial sums of numbers not divisible by any of their digits. The partial sums of the complement (A038770, numbers divisible by at least one of their digits) is A176659. Hence the sum of the two partial sums (properly offset) is triangular numbers A000217. The subsequence of primes in the partial sum begins: 23, 79, 113, 277, 373, 593, 1061, 1733, 2131, 4447, 9479. The smallest square in the sequence is 324."
