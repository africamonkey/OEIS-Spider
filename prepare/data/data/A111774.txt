        "This is (x*(x+1)-y*(y+1))/2 for nonnegative integers x,y with x-y>=3, because it is equivalent to 1+2+3/+4/+5/...+x/-0/-1/-2/-3/-4/-5/...-(x+3)/ for all possible strings of consecutive integers, which represents every possible way to sum three or more consecutive positive integers. So for example, 4+5+6+7 = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7-1-2-3 = 22, which is x*(x+1)-y*(y+1))/2 when x=7, y=3. Notice that values can appear more than once in the array because some numbers can be represented as sums of more than one string of three or more consecutive positive integers. For example, 30 = x*(x+1)-y*(y+1))/2 when (a) x=11, y=8: 9+10+11; (b) x=9, y=5: 6+7+8+9; and (c) x=8, y=3: 4+5+6+7+8.  By definition, x-y is the number of integers in the string. - _Bob Selcoe_, Feb 23 2014"
