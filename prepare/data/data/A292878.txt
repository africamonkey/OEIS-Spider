        "A walk begins at the origin, and each step can be in one of five directions: Up (0,0,1), Left (-1,0,0), Right (1,0,0), Forward (0,-1,0) or Backward (0,1,0), satisfying the condition that within each plane z=k, the path may only move away from the first step into that plane. This concept generalizes the \"Number of n step one-sided prudent walks with east, west and north steps\" of A001333.",
