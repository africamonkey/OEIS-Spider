        "10^19 < a(9) <= 725298909352131113041. Terms a(3) through a(8) all have the prime signature p^4*q^2*r^2. Any x such that sigma(x) = -1 (mod 30) must have at least eight prime factors. However, for all n, there are solutions with fewer than three distinct prime factors. More generally, for any k > 1, let p be a prime of the form mk+1; then sigma(p^(k-2)) = -1 (mod k). For a(9), 725298909352131113041 is the least solution with eight prime factors. I have not been able to rule out a smaller solution with more prime factors. - _David Wasserman_, Dec 14 2007"
