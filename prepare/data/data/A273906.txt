        "The only palindrome in this sequence below 10^9 is 11 (per request of _Giovanni Teofilatto_). A004022 is a subsequence. - _David A. Corneth_, Jun 10 2016",
        "If we have a concatenation of two palindromes A = A', B = B' which is palindromic, concat(A,B) =: A.B = (A.B)' = B'.A' = B.A, then A*(10^LB-1) = B*(10^LA-1) (LX = length of X) <=>  A*R(LB) = B*R(LA), where R(n) = (10^n-1)/9. To have A.B prime we also must have gcd(A,B) = 1, thus A | R(LA) and B | R(LB). Such numbers are listed in A249647 (not A014950), the only palindromes there are of the form 1...1, 3...3 or 9...9. Thus the only palindromic terms in this sequence A273906 are the repunit primes A004022. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 10 2016"
