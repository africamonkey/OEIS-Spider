Moser proves that 60 is the last term in the sequence. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Dec 22 2011 [A rough translation of the title of this book is \"A hundred elementary but tough problems in arithmetic.\" No English translation appears to exist, but there are several later books by Sierpi\u0144ski with similar titles that have been translated. I don't know if they give the Moser reference. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 26 2011]",
