    "comment": [
        "This sequence was made by taking the Fibonacci numbers, leaving out one of the starting 1's, raising them to the power of 2 * the golden ratio. Fractions are removed with the floor function. It works particularly well as a gap sequence for the shell sort algorithm on large arrays."
