        "The sequence is complete. Proof: We must find a prime p>61 and an integer m such that p = m^3 - (1+7+19+37+61) = m^3 - 125 = (m - 5)*(m^2 + 5*m + 25). Since p is prime, we must have p=1*p, therefore set m=6 to make p = (6-5)(6^2 + 5*6 + 25) = 1*91. However, 91=7*13 (not prime). Since m=6 is the only answer for which m-5=1, we can conclude that there is no prime p satisfying the equation. - Francois Jooste (pin(AT)myway.com), Mar 09 2003"
