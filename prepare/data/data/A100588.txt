    "name": "Numerical value of the following string operation iterated n-1 times on the string \"1\": (1) Concatenate \"0\" to the left and to the right to the old string and initialize a new string. (2) Scan the old string from left to right. Whenever \"00\" occurs in the old string, write \"0\" to the new string; whenever \"01\" or \"10\" occurs in the old string, write \"1\" to the new string; whenever \"11\" occurs in the old string, write \"10\" to the new string.",
    "example": [
        "Applying the operation to the initial string \"1\" gives us \"11\". Subsequent iterations give us \"1101\" and \"110111\". The numerical values corresponding to the binary strings \"1,\" \"11,\" \"1101,\" and \"110111\" are, of course, 1, 3, 13 and 55."
