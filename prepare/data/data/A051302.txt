        "Observations regarding terms through a(64)=306761364: All are multiples of 7^2, 13^2, and/or 19^2. Other than 2, 3, 5 and 11, their only prime factors are 7, 13, 19, 31, 43, 61, 67, 79, 127, 151, and 181 (each of which exceeds a multiple of 6 by 1). None is a cube or higher power; the ones that are squares are a(7), a(12), a(17), a(19), a(20), a(32), a(33), a(41), a(49), a(55), and a(58). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Oct 08 2006",
        "Many of the terms beyond a(64) have prime factors other than those found in a(1) through a(64); however, each term through a(774) has at most one distinct prime factor p > 5 that does not exceed a multiple of 6 by 1, and p, if such a prime factor exists, has a multiplicity m=3, with only a few exceptions: n=651 and n=713 (where p^m is 11^2), n=346 and n=770 (where p^m is 17^2), n=699 and n=740 (where p^m is 23^2), and n=741 (where p^m is 11^6). - _Jon E.

It is obvious that if (a, b) and (c, d) are distinct, then (k^2*a, k^2*b), (k^2*c, k^2*d) are also distinct for all nonzero values of k. So if n is in this sequence, then n*k^3 is in this sequence for all k > 0. - _Altug Alkan_, May 10 2016"
