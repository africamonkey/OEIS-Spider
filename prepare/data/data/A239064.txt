        "The solution of this problem can be found as follows. Consider k*x^2 + (k+1)*x + (k+2) - a^2 = 0. Solve for x (positive) as function of k: x = (-(k+1) + sqrt((2*a)^2*k - c(k)))/(2*k), where c(k) = 3*k(k+2) - 1 is the sequence [8, 23, 44, 71, 104, 143, 188, 239, 296, 359,...]. A necessary condition for a solution is (2*a)^2*k - c(k) = b^2, or k*X^2 - Y^2 = c(k), with X = 2*a and Y = b. This is a binary indefinite quadratic form with discriminant D = (2^2)*k > 0. If k is a square then there is no solution with even X because (K*X)^2 - Y^2 = c(K^2) has only the solution with K=1, X=3, Y=1. For k not a square there are either no solutions for given k (e.g., k = 5, 6, 10, ...) or countable infinitely many ones of the representation k*X^2 - Y^2 = c(k). From the solutions one has to pick first the ones with even X (a = X/2) and then to test whether 2*k divides Y - (k+1). The solution for x is then x = (Y - (k+1))/(2*k).",
