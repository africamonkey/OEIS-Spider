    "comment": [
        "See the main entry (A097403) for more details. One statute mile is 5280 feet. The first thirteen terms here are derived directly (by me) by converting the corresponding terms of A097403 from knots to statute miles per hour (rounding to the nearest mph). (Whether I use 6076.115, 6080, or 6080.20 feet per nautical mile, makes no difference in the results of my conversions.) The remaining five terms are taken directly from Webster's Third (W3) since I do not currently have all the corresponding terms for A097403. (W3 also indicates that Beaufort Number 17 has an upper limit of 136 mph.) There are discrepancies among my sources for a(2), a(4), a(5) and a(12). Notably, a Merriam-Webster Dictionary says in a footnote that the U.S. uses a(12)=74 for hurricane -- but both it and W3 list 73 in their main tables (so, presumably, those tables are UK- or internationally-oriented). Both dictionaries give a(2)=4 and a(5)=19."
