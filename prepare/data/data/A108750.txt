    "comment": [
        "The alternating groups A_n with n even can be generated by a 3-cycle x=(1,2,3) and an (n-1)-cycle y=(2,3,...n) whose product has cycle type 2 x (n-2). These are called standard generators of A_n. If we assume only that o(y)=n-1 and o(xy)=n-2, then for the values of n in the sequence, y could be the product of 2 cycles (cycle type (r+s).t) and xy can have cycle type s.(r+t). Thus the elements of the sequence give those alternating groups A_n which contain pairs of elements which look like standard generators if one only looks at their orders."
