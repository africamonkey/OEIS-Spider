        "a(n) is the number of ways of drawing any number of nonintersecting chords joining n (labeled) points on a circle, such that when gluing the second half of one copy to the first half of the other so that each point k along the intersection is glued to n+1-k, the result is homotopic to the original.",
        "a(n+1) > a(n) for every n.",
        "The structure of the Motzkin monoid (and particularly its idempotents and some associated orderings) is governed intimately by the combinatorics of so-called Motzkin paths and Motzkin words, which are related to Dyck paths and words respectively by insertion of punctuation into the words, or marking/coloring subpaths.",
        "Bounded above by A026945, strictly for n > 1. Bounded below by the square of A001006, strictly for n > 1."
