        "These numbers are sometimes called Eisenstein-Mersenne cofactors EQ(n).",

        "Following an idea of Harsh Aggarwal, some of these numbers have been discovered as by-products of the search for prime Eisenstein-Mersenne norms. The reason of that is the Aurifeuillan factorization of T(k) = 3^(3k) + 1 with k odd. These numbers can be written as T(k) = (3^k + 1)*EM(k)*EQ(k)*7, EM(k) is the norm of the Eisenstein-Mersenne (1-\u03c9)^k-1, while EQ(k) is the norm of ((1-\u03c9)^a[n]+1)/(2-\u03c9).",
