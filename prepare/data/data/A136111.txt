        "Note that it is impossible to have three consecutive positive even integers which have odd sigma() values.",
        "In order to have an odd sigma() value, the integer must be a square or twice a square; it's not too hard to see that three consecutive positive even integers can't each be a square or twice a square.",
        "So any solution must have n odd and among n+1 and n+3, one of them must be a square and the other must be twice a square.",
        "Any other terms exceed 10^128."
