        "See A178160 for definition of \"type-2 Trott-like constant.\"",
        "Each time a type-2 Trott-like constant is extended by one digit, the size of the interval encompassing all the values that can be reached using the terms of an infinitely-extended sequence of positive one-digit numbers directly as digits (e.g., [0.375511111...,0.375599999...]) decreases by a factor of 10.",
        "However, the size of the interval encompassing all the values that can be reached using the terms of such a sequence as terms of a continued fraction of the type used in the second Trott constant (A091694) decreases more slowly.",
        "As a result, as the number of digits increases, the continued-fraction interval increasingly dwarfs the other interval, as is seen in comparing the intervals for a(3)=15751525912:",

        "which defines an interval whose width is about 0.0000223, while the width of the interval [0.15751525912111...,0.15751525912999...] is only 0.00000000000888....",
        "Inextensible type-2 Trott-like constants can occur only when one of the endpoints of the continued-fraction interval happens to fall inside the much smaller interval; this becomes less and less likely as the number of digits increases.",
        "Also, because inextensible cases arise only when increasing the value of a proposed next digit would cause the continued fraction value to increase, inextensible cases must satisfy (k+1) mod 4 < 2, where k is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. An exhaustive search found no 12-digit inextensible cases, so a(4) > 10^14."
