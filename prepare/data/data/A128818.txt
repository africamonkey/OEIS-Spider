        "Abstract: \"I explore physics implications of the External Reality Hypothesis (ERH) that there exists an external physical reality completely independent of us humans. I argue that with a sufficiently broad definition of mathematics, it implies the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that our physical world is an abstract mathematical structure. I discuss various implications of the ERH and MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible representations, units, free parameters and initial conditions to broader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness. I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and help explain why our physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relation between mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physical systems.\"",
        "Tegmark: \"This is the 'director's cut' version of the Sep 15 2007 New Scientist cover story. For references, see the 'full strength' version at arXiv:0704.0646. I advocate an extreme 'shut-up-and-calculate' approach to physics, where our external physical reality is assumed to be purely mathematical. This brief essay motivates this 'it's all just equations' assumption and discusses its implications.\""
