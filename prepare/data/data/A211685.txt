        "Only numbers > 1000 are considered, since all 3-digit primes are trivial members.",
        "By definition, each term of the sequence with more than 4 digits is built up by an overlapped union of previous terms, i.e., a(59)=33739 has the two embedded previous terms a(14)=3373 and a(21)=3739.",
        "The sequence is finite, the last term is 349199 (n=63). Proof of finiteness: Let p be a number with more than 6 digits. By the argument above, each 6-digit substring of p must be a previous term. The only 6-digit term is 349199. Thus, there is no number p with the desired property."
