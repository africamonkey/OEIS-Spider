    "comment": [
        "All but two members of the sequence below 20000000 are the products of two primes separated by 6 or 16 and have digit sums of 25 or 26, which have proper divisor sums of 6 (=1+5) and 16(=1+2+13) respectively. The exceptions are the 1st term (57), which has a digit sum of 12 and the 67th (18999857), which has a digit sum of 56."

        "The divisors of 57 are 1, 3 and 19, so the difference of the two largest is 16.",
