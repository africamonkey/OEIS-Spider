        "The proportion of prime terms has a tendency to increase. For example, 4 from the first 10 terms; 10 from the first 20 terms; 16 from the first 30 terms; 24 from the first 40 terms; 40 from the first 60 terms, 88 from the first 110 terms. We conjecture that this proportion asymptotically tends to 1."
