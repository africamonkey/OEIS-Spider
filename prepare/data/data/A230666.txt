    "comment": [
        "The triangle inequality requires that any integer triangle with a fixed side length of 3 can have remaining side lengths of (x, x+1) or (x, x+2). The constraint that primitive Heronian triangles have only one even side will just permit (x, x+1). So a(n) = x or x+1 whenever the Heronian triangle has x or x+1 as a prime and n is the ordered occurrence of this prime. The ordered sequence of x is given by A072221 where x(n) = 6x(n-1)-x(n-2)+2, x(0)=1, x(1)=4 starting at x(1)."

    "example": [
        "a(2)=149 because the triangle with sides (3, 148, 149) is Heronian, 149 is prime and is the 2nd occurrence of such a prime with triangle sides (3, 4, 5) giving 5 as the 1st occurrence."
