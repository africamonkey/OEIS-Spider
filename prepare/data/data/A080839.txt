        "The slowest-growing sequence of length n is 1,2,4,6,...,2(n-1). The fastest-growing sequence is 1,2,4,8,...,2^(n-1). The ratio a(n+1)a(n-1)/a(n)^2 appears to converge to a constant near 1.46, which is the approximate growth rate of A001609. Are the sequences related? - _T. D. Noe_, Feb 05 2007"
