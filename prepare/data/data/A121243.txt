        "This sequence is complementary to A105389 in the sense that the two sequences are disjoint and their union constitutes all primes p satisfying Mod[p,8]=1.",
        "Primes satisfying Mod[p,8]=1 are of form x^2+8y^2 (A007519), with the sequence above as odd y, while A105389 is even y. This can be seen by expressing the former as (2x+y)^2+8y^2 (where y can only be odd), while the latter is u^2+8(2v)^2. [From _Tito Piezas III_, Jan 01 2009]"
