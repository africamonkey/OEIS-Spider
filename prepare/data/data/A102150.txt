    "example": [
        "The copy of the first \"2\" is to be found in \"12\", 2 jumps to the right.",
        "The copy of the first \"3\" is to be found in \"123\", 3 jumps to the right.",
        "The copy of the first \"1\" is to be found in \"13\", 1 jump to the right, etc.",
        "The \"3\" of \"13\" comes from the obligation of having the smallest gap between two integers. The same reason explains the apparition of the first \"4\" (the next integer after 123 is 124). The digit \"0\" obeys the same rules and doesn't copy itself anywhere, of course."
