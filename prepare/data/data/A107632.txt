Consider a Gaussian prime a+bi with index k in A103431. k is in A107632 when an integer multiplier m exists such that the distance of m*norm(a+bi) to k is minimal up to k. abs(m*norm(a+bi) - k) is minimal up to k. A107633 gives the squares of the norms of these Gaussian primes, A107634 the integer multipliers m.",
