        "A series of n games are played between two teams. The outcome of each game is either a win or a loss (there are no draws). A team wins the whole series if it wins k=floor(n/2)+1 games or more. If a team reaches k wins then the games that follow (if there are any) are dead games, because their outcome cannot affect the outcome of the series.",
