    "comment": [
        "This is a higher dimensional version of non-crossing partitions and Catalan numbers.  Given an arrangement of n circles on the 2-sphere, we can consider an unoriented surface in the 3-ball whose boundary is the given circles.  Given such a surface, we get a partition of the circles by saying that two circles are in the same block if they are part of the boundary of a single connected component of the surface.  The possible circle arrangements (up to isomorphism) are in bijection with unrooted trees with n edges, so we have a function from unrooted trees to the positive integers.  This sequence is for linear trees with n edges and maximum valence 2."
