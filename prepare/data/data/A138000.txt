    "comment": [
        "Obviously one must exclude previously used primes. Here this is done by requiring 2^n subsets; equivalently, one could require a(n) to be different from preceding terms, or larger than a(n-1). (If a value smaller than a(n-1) were possible, then a(n-1) would not have been the minimal choice.)",
        "If we replace \"prime\" with \"noncomposite\", the sequence starts 1, 2, 5, 11, 23, 43, 89, 179, 359, 719, 1433, 2879, ... and seems to coincide with A064934, having a different definition, though.",
        "The present sequence clearly (cf. a(4)) would not be the same if the definition be changed to \"least prime larger than the sum of preceding terms\" (as in A064934).",
        "It can be seen that a(n) is always very close to Sum_{i=1..n-1} a(i). As a consequence, the sequence grows like a(n) ~ 2^(n-0.256...) and thus is not a counter-example to Erd\u0151s's conjecture mentioned in the cited paper.",
        "The sequence of partial sums, s(n) = Sum_{i=1..n} a(i) =",
        "(2,5,12,23,52,105,...) is of alternating parity. If s(n)-1 is prime, this is an upper bound for a(n+1), since the smallest element of the sequence is 2; e.g., a(4) = s(3)-1. Thus if s(n) is even, a(n+1) <= nextprime(s(n)-1). If s(n) is odd, then a(n+1) may be nextprime(s(n)+2) (since the value of s(n) itself is never admissible), as in the case of a(3) = 5 + 2 > s(2) = 5, which is prime."
