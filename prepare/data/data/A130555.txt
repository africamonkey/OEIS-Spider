        "This is to 6th powers as A130292 is to fifth powers, A130873 is to 4th powers and A120398 is to cubes. These can never be prime, as sixth powers are cubes and the sum of cubes factorizations applies. There are semiprimes for values beginning a(1) = 793, a(2) = 15689 = 29 * 541, a(4) = 117713 = 53 * 2221, a(11) = 4826873 = 173 * 27901."
