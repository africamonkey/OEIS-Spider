        "a(n+4)=:b(n), n>=1, enumerates the ways to distribute n beads labeled differently from 1 to n, over a set of (unordered) necklaces, excluding necklaces with exactly one bead, and k=5 indistinguishable, ordered, fixed cords, each allowed to have any number of beads. Beadless necklaces as well as a beadless cords contribute each a factor 1 in the counting, e.g., b(0):= 1*1 =1. See A000255 for the description of a fixed cord with beads.",
        "This produces for b(n) the exponential (aka binomial) convolution of the subfactorial sequence {A000166(n)} and the sequence {A001720(n+4) = (n+4)!/4!}. See the necklaces and cords problem comment in A000153. Therefore also the recurrence b(n) = (n+4)*b(n-1) + (n-1)*b(n-2) with b(-1)=0 and b(0)=1 holds. This comment derives from a family of recurrences found by Malin Sjodahl for a combinatorial problem for certain quark and gluon diagrams (Feb 27 2010). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 02 2010"

For n=4 one considers the following weak 2 part compositions of 4: (4,0), (3,1), (2,2), and (0,4), where (1,3) does not appear because there are no necklaces with 1 bead. These compositions contribute respectively sf(4)*1, binomial(4,3)*sf(3)*c5(1), (binomial(4,2)*sf(2))*c5(2), and 1*c5(4) with the subfactorials sf(n):=A000166(n) (see the necklace comment there) and the c5(n):=A001720(n+4) numbers for the pure 5 cord problem (see the remark on the e.g.f. for the k cords problem in A000153; here for k=5: 1/(1-x)^5).
