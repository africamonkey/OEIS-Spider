        "Roger Penrose posed the problem of finding the missing term in the sequence \"..., 7, 9, 12, ???, 24, 36, 56, 90, ...\".",
        "The answer is that the sequence is given by a(n) = 24*(2^n-1)/n, for n = -3, -2, ..., 3, 4 and so the missing entry is (by l'Hopital's rule) 24 log 2 = 16.6355323... [This has been replaced by 16 here to get an integer sequence.]",
        "The sequence for n = -10, ..., 10 is 3069/1280, 511/192, 765/256, 381/112, 63/16, 93/20, 45/8, 7, 9, 12, 24 log 2, 24, 36, 56, 90, 744/5, 252, 3048/7, 765, 4088/3, 12276/5."
