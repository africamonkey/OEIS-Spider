        "These primes are the only primes, p(j) = A000040(j), such that (p(j)-p(j-m)) divides (p(j)+p(j-m)) for some m, 0 < m < j. For all such cases, m=1. It is easy to prove for j-m>1 the only common factor of (p(j)-p(j-m)) and (p(j)+p(j-m)) is 2, and there are no common factors if j-m = 1. Thus, p(j-m) is the lesser member of a twin prime pair, except when j=2. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Mar 25 2015"
