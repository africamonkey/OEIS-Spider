        "The number of all permutations of elements of sets {1..k}, k <= n, is b(n) = Sum_{k=0..n} k! while the number of all permutations of elements of all subsets of set {1,2..n} is c(n) = Sum_{k=0..n} binomial(n,k)!. So the required probability (in a sample space) is b(n)/c(n), n >= 1 (after reduction of the fractions)."
