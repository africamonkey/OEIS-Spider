    "comment": [
        "In a sense, this measures the increase in combinatorial structures available by dropping the requirement of inverses, and an identity element, in moving from the group axioms to the semigroup axioms. A semigroup is mathematical object defined for a set and a binary operator in which the multiplication operation is associative. No other restrictions are placed on a semigroup; thus a semigroup need not have an identity element and its elements need not have inverses within the semigroup. Other sequences may be derived by considering commutative semigroups and commutative groups, self-converse semigroup, counting  idempotents, and the like."
