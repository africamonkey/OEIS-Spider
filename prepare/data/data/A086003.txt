        "The rotate operation of nonnegative integers is defined in A086002, which lists the primes that remain prime after one application of the compound rotate-and-add operation. The sequence here lists those primes p which in addition remain prime after applying this transformation twice, that is, those elements of A086002 such that the image of the rotate-and-add operation is again in A086002."
