    "comment": [
        "A sweet Boolean function is a monotone function whose BDD (binary decision diagram) is the same as the ZDD (zero-suppressed decision diagram) for its prime implicants (aka minimal solutions).",
        "Equivalently, this is the number of sweet antichains contained in {1,...,n}. (Also called sweet clutters.) A sweet antichain whose largest element is n is a family of subsets A \\cup (n\\cup B) where A and B are sweet antichains in {1,...n-1}, B is nonempty and every element of A properly contains some element of B.",
        "The property of being \"sweet\" depends on the order of the variables - compare A114491."

    "example": [
        "All six of the antichains in {1,2} are sweet. They are emptyset, {emptyset}, {{1}}, {{2}}, {{1,2}} and {{1},{2}}.",
        "Only 18 of the 20 antichains in {1,2,3} are sweet. The nonsweet ones are {{1,3},{2}} and {{1},{2,3}}. Because, in the latter case, A={1} and B={2}. However, {{1,2},{3}} is sweet because A={{1,2}} and B={emptyset}.",
        "Some of the most interesting members of this apparently new family of Boolean functions are the connectedness functions, defined on the edges of any graph. The function f=[these arcs give a connected subgraph] is sweet, under any ordering of the arcs. Threshold functions [x_1+...+x_n >= k] are sweet too.",
        "Also the conjunction of sweet functions on disjoint sets of variables is sweet."
