        "The polynomials having coefficients in {0,1} are enumerated as in A206074.  The sequence A206717 shows the numbers of those satisfying p(n,r)=0, where r=(-1+i*sqrt(3))/2.  Is every term divisible by 7?",
        "Yes, because if p(n,x) is divisible by p(7,x) = 1 + x + x^2, then n = p(n,2) is divisible by p(7,2) = 7. Similarly, A000120(n) is divisible by 3, because A000120(n) = p(n,1) must be divisible by p(7,1) = 3.  The least n such that n is divisible by 7 and A000120(n) is divisible by 3 but n is not in the sequence is 4683. - _Robert Israel_, Nov 03 2014"
