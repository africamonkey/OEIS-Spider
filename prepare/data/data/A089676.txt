        "Consider the 2^n points {0,1}^n in real Euclidean space. Then a(n) = maximal size of a subset S of these 2^n points such that there is no triple of points P,Q,R in S which subtends a right angle. That is, we are not allowed to have P-Q perpendicular to R-Q.",
        "There is an existence proof due to Erd\u0151s and F\u00fcredi that exponentially large subsets S exist: see for example Theorem 2.3 of Noga Alon's survey \"Probabilistic Methods in Extremal Finite Set Theory\". This was improved by Bevan and later by Ackerman and Ben-Zwi.",
        "Comment from Hugues Randriambololona, Apr 08 2016: As explained by Erd\u0151s-Furedi, these sets of points are equivalent to set systems none of which is sandwiched between the intersection and the union of two others. In turn these are equivalent to so-called (2,1)-separating systems. As far as I know the best construction is the one in my Israel J. Math. 2013 paper. It uses algebraic geometry and coding techniques, and it implies a lower bound on a(n) of roughly 11^{3n/50}. This is better than Erd\u0151s-Furedi, Bevan, or Ackerman-Ben-Zwi, which are all about (4/3)^{n/2}. It is remarkable that this construction beats the probabilistic method (and note that it implies that for large n, naive computer search will have exponentially small chance to find optimal configurations). I should also add that Erd\u0151s-Furedi claimed (without proof) a lower bound of 2^{n/4} which, if correct, would be even better (but also non-constructive).",
