        "This sequence lists the positions of nonzero digits in the sequence, where the terms are written in base 3 and concatenated, such that the least significant digit (units) of a(n) is followed by the most significant digit of a(n+1)."

        "For the same reason, a(3) = 3[10] = 10[3]. (All terms are written in base 3.)",
