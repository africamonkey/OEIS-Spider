        "Triggered by a comment from _Michael Kleber_, Dec 08 2009, who said: The algorithm in my paper with Cook lets you compute the equivalent sequence where the children of a node labeled (k) are labeled with all the integers in the interval [p(k),q(k)] where p,q are any polynomials you like (in the paper, p(k)=k+1 and q(k)=2k). For a bunch of p,q the resulting seq is well-known, eg p(k)=1,q(k)=k+1 is the Catalan numbers."
