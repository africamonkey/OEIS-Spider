        "Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 0. In general, for any n consecutive primes p_k,...,p_{k+n-1}, there always exists a permutation q_k,...,q_{k+n-1} of p_k,...,p_{k+n-1} with q_{k+n-1} = p_{k+n-1} such that the n-1 numbers |q_k-q_{k+1}|, |q_{k+1}-q_{k+2}|,...,|q_{k+n-2}-q_{k+n-1}| are pairwise distinct. (In the case k = 2, this implies that a(n) > 0.)",

        "On Aug 31 2013, Zhi-Wei Sun proved the following extension of the general conjecture: Let a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n be a sequence of n distinct real numbers in ascending order.

In fact, when n = 2*k is even we may take (b_1,...,b_n) = (a_k,a_{k+1},a_{k-1},a_{k+2},...,a_2,a_{2k-1},a_1,a_{2k}); when n = 2*k-1 is odd we may take (b_1,...,b_n) = (a_k,a_{k-1},a_{k+1},a_{k-2},a_{k+2},..., a_2,a_{2k-2},a_1,a_{2k-1}).",

        "  (ii) Let a_1, ..., a_n be n distinct elements of a finite additive abelian group G. Suppose that |G| is not divisible by n, or n is even and G is cyclic. Then there exists a permutation b_1, ..., b_n of a_1, ..., a_n with b_1 = a_1 such that the n-1 differences b_{i+1}-b_i (i = 1, ..., n-1) are pairwise distinct.",
