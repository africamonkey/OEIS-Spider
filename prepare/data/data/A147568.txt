        "Every odd number m>=9 is a unique sum of the form a(k)+2a(l); moreover this sequence is the unique one with such property. In connection with A103151, note that there is no subsequence T of primes such that every odd number m>=9 is expressible as a unique sum of the form m=p+2q, where p and q are in T. One can prove that if one replaces 9 by any integer x_o>9, the statement remains true (see the preprint arxiv.org/abs/0811.0290)."
