        "The required number of index tests (test for termination and test in the final reversion loop) becomes 0.2613625*n! for large n, if the test for n=3 is excluded. If n=3 is included the additionally required termination test adds n!/6 index comparisons, increasing the number of index comparisons to 0.428029*n! (63.8% more index comparisons).",
