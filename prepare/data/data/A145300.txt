        "Theorem. a(n)<=p_n+2sqrt(2p_n)+2. For example, for n=25, p_n=97. Using the theorem, we find: a(25)<=126. Now, by the definition of the sequence, we verify that a(25)=113.",

Note, that in the considered case this conjecture is equivalent to the following: lim{sqrt(p_n*q_n}=0, where {x} denotes the fractional part of x. [From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Oct 09 2008]"
