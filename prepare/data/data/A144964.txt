        "Let Y_n be the set of trees of degree n. A nonempty subset of Y_n is called a grove. The set of all groves of degree n is denoted by Y_n. a(n) for n<= 7 given by rightmost column of Table 1, p. 3, of Bruno and Yasaki: The arithmetic of the natural numbers N can be extended to arithmetic operations on planar binary trees. This gives rise to a noncommutative arithmetic theory. In this exposition, we describe this arithmetree, first defined by Loday and investigate prime trees."
