For any odd number k, last digit can be trivially 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, that is, the last digit of k+1 is 2, 4, 6, 8, 0 for corresponding odd k values. There cannot be square such that last digit of it 2 or 8. So in this sequence, there is no term such that the last digit of it 1 or 7. - _Altug Alkan_, May 11 2016"
