        "An aglet is a tag or sheath on the end of a lace to facilitate its passing through eyelet holes.",
        "There are C(2n,k) ways of picking up k aglets out of 2*n aglets. All of them are equally likely. Picking up k aglets leaves 2n - k aglets not picked up. Each of these 2n - k aglets must be on a different shoelace in order to get all the shoelaces. There are C(n,2n - k) combinations of shoelaces with a not-picked aglet.",
        "Each not-picked aglet can be on either end, so we multiply C(n,2n - k) by 2^(2n - k) for a total of 2^(2n - k) * C(n,2n - k) ways to get all the shoelaces. So we want So 2^(2n - k) * C(n,2n - k) > (1/2) * C(2n,k).",
        "The following PARI code can be used to calculate k, it solves for 50% probability, pretending that the problem is continuous, then takes the ceiling to get to the realistic k value required.",
