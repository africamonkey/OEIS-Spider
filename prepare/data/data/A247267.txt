        "Subsequence of A225885. It is easy to see that the multiples of 100 in A225885 are earlier entries of the sequence multiplied by 100, so this sequence removes this redundancy in some sense.  It appears that all entries in A225885 after the first 3 entries ends in either 25 or 00, so this sequence appears to end in 25 after the first 3 entries."
