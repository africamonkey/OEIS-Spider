    "comment": [
        "Sphinx tilings are, by convention, understood to be improper tilings composed of two elementary shapes, order-1 sphinxes, that are mirror images of one another. In other words, one can prove that the tiling of an order-n sphinx requires both L-sphinxes and R-sphinxes (each composed of six equilateral triangles) for any n>1. The sequence terms are based on an initial search-tree method by G. Huber, confirmed and extended by W. Trump using backtracking and a bit-vector method.",
        "Least-squares fitting indicates a growth law in the form of an exponential of a quadratic in n (i.e., proportional to g^(area), where g is a constant).",
