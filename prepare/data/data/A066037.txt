    "comment": [
        "This is the number of ways of making a list of the 2^n nodes of the n-cube, with a distinguished starting position and a direction, such that each node is adjacent to the previous one and the last node is adjacent to the first; and then dividing the total by 2^(n+1) because the starting node and the direction do not really matter.",
        "The number is a multiple of n!/2 since any directed cycle starting from 0^n induces a permutation on the n bits, namely the order in which they first get set to 1."
