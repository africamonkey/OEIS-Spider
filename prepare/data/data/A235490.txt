    "name": "Numbers such that none of their prime factors share common 1-bits in the same bit-position and when added (or \"ored\" or \"xored\") together, yield a term of A000225 (a binary \"repunit\").",
    "comment": [
        "a(1) = 1 is included on the grounds that it has no prime factors, thus A001414(1)=0, and 0 is one of the terms of A000225, marking the \"repunit of length zero\".",
        "After 1, the sequence is a union of A000668 (Mersenne primes) and semiprimes of the form 2*A050415. The terms were constructed from the data given in those two entries."

    "example": [
        "7 is included, because it is a prime, and repunit in base-2: '111'.",
        "10 is included, as 10=2*5, and when we add 2 ('10' in binary) and 5 ('101' in binary), we also get 7 ('111' in binary), without producing any carries."
