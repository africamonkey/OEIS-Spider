        "409 is NOT in the list because, although it is a prime and although 49 is a square, 49 is not an anagram of 409 because it does not contain the digit zero. In other words, an anagram of a prime, for purposes of this sequence, must have the same number of digits as the prime has. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Aug 29 2017"
