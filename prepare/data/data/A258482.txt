        "The terms in this sequence have only an odd number of digits. If they would have an even number of digits both parts would have the same length. The maximum difference x^2 - y^2 would be (10^m-1)^2 - 1^2, which is (10^m-2)*10^m. But this is always less than (10^m-1)^2 + 1, so m never equals x^2 - y^2.",
