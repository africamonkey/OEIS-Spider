        "Let say that an integer n divides a lattice if there exists a sublattice of index n. Example: 3 divides the hexagonal lattice. Then A003136 (Loeschian numbers) is the sequence of divisors of the hexagonal lattice. Say that n is a \"prime divisor\" if the index-n sublattice is not contained in any other sublattice except the original lattice itself. The present sequence gives the prime divisors of the hexagonal lattice. Similarly, A055025 (Norms of Gaussian primes) is the sequence of \"prime divisors\" of the square lattice. - _Jean-Christophe Herv\u00e9_, Dec 04 2006"
