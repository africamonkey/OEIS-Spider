        "Naturally, all the terms of A000396, including 137438691328, are in this sequence. - _Antti Karttunen_, Dec 01 2017",
        "Thus, if there are infinitely many Mersenne primes, then this sequence is also, by definition of even perfect numbers, infinite. - _Iain Fox_, Dec 02 2017",
        "All non-perfect terms are abundant. Proof: Assume d is a deficient number in this sequence. Because multiples of abundant numbers are abundant, d cannot have an abundant divisor, thus all its divisors are nonabundant. Since d is in this sequence, the sum of its proper divisors, which are all nonabundant, must equal d. However, if this were true, then d would be perfect. Therefore, this sequence contains no deficient numbers. - _Iain Fox_, Dec 07 2017",
