        "The sequence consists of those terms of A255571 whose every A080541/A080542-rotation is also a term of A255571 and in their binary representation the number of 1's is larger than the number of 0's. More precisely, after the initial term a(0)=1 (which stands for an empty path) each term has seven more 1's than 0's in their binary representation, i.e., A037861(a(n)) = -7 for all n >= 1."
