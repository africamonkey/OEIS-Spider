        "This sequence was generated by adding 12 Fibonacci-like sequences [See: PROG]. Looking at the format 90n+41 modulo 9 and modulo 10 we see that all entries of A142333 have digital root 5 and last digit 1. (Reverting the process is an application of the Chinese remainder theorem.) The 12 Fibonacci-like sequences are generated (via the PERL program) from the base pairs 49*91, 19*59, 37*23, 73*77, 11*61, 29*79, 47*43, 83*7, 13*17, 31*71, 49*89, 67*53."
