        "Define an n X n matrix A[i,j] by A[i,j]=x_(i+j), subscripts on x being interpreted mod n. This is a generic circulant matrix. If we expand det(A) we obtain a polynomial in the x_i. Define a(n) to be the number of terms in this polynomial after like terms have been combined. (Replacing det(A) with per(A), the permanent of A, we get sequence A003239)."
