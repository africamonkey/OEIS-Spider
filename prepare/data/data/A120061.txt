        "A universal cycle of permutations is a cycle of n! digits such that each permutation of {1,...,n} occurs exactly once as a block of n-1 consecutive digits (with its redundant final element suppressed). a(4)=2^7*3, a(5)=2^33*3^8*5^3, a(6)=2^190*3^49*5^33, a(7)=2^1217*3^123*5^119*7^5*11^28*43^35*73^20*79^21*109^35 ~=1.582284037*10^747."
