        "All numbers of the form (5n+1)^2 + 4n + 1 for n>0 are elements of this sequence. Numbers of the above form have the continued fraction expansion [5n+1,[2,2,10n+2]]. General square roots of integers with period 3 continued fraction expansions have expansions of the form [n,[2m,2m,2n]]. - _David Terr_, Jun 15 2004"
