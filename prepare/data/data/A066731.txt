        "n is f-triperfect iff sum_{k divides n} f(k) = 3*f(n). f-triperfect numbers appear to be rare for many f. For the usual f(n) = n, there are at least 6 f-triperfect numbers known < 3.2 x 10^10, the first being 120. However, there are no f-triperfect numbers < 10^6 for f(n) = n+1 and f(n) = n-1 (if one ignores the trivial n = 1).",
