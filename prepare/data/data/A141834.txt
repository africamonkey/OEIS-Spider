        "In graph theory, a complete graph is a simple graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. The complete graph on n vertices is denoted by K_n. The number of simple cycles through a vertex of K_n equals A038154(n-1). See A000522 for the number of paths between a pair of distinct vertices of K_n."

        "a(4) = 42. In the complete graph K_4 with vertex set {A,B,C,D} there are 12 simple cycles at the vertex A, namely the six 3-cycles ABCA, ABDA, ACBA, ACDA, ADBA and ADCA and the six 4-cycles ABCDA, ABDCA, ACBDA, ACDBA, ADBCA and ADCBA. The sum of the lengths of these cycles is 6*3 + 6*4 = 42."
