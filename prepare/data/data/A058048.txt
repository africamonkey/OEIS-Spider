    "name": "For each prime P consider the generalized Collatz sequence of each integer N > 1 defined by c(0) = N, c(m+1) = c(m) * P + 1 if F > P, else c(m+1) = c(m) / F, where F is the smallest factor of c(m), until the sequence cycles. If all c(i) > 1 for some starting number N then P belongs to the sequence (and vice versa).",

        "Missing primes are as yet only conjectures. _Jeff Heleen_ checked the primes < 1000 and start points up to 10000000 (see Prime Puzzle 114 and example below). P=3 is the ordinary Collatz problem."
