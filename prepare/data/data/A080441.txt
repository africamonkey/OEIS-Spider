        "Conjecture: Only one digit needs to be inserted between each pair of digits of a(n-1) to get a(n); i.e. a(n) contains exactly 2n-1 digits for n > 1.",
        "The conjecture above is false: a(5)=10000000000003037 has 17 digits instead of 2*5-1=9. A refined conjecture is: a(n) contains exactly 2^(n-1) + 1 digits for all n>0. This follows trivially by induction from the initial conjecture above of only one digit needed between each pair, and the fact that we start with 17, a 2 digit number, and holds true at least till a(12)."
