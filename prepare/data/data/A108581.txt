        "In terms of the repetition convolution operator #, where (sequence A) # (sequence B) = the sequence consisting of A(n) copies of B(n), then this sequence is the repetition self-convolution (A000217(n)-0) # (A000217(n)-0). Over the set of positive infinite integer sequences, # gives a nonassociative noncommutative groupoid with a left identity (A000012) but no right identity, where the left identity is also a right nullifier and idempotent."
