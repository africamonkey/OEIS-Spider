        "Partial sums of A245883. This may be proved using two facts: (i) the number of connected components of a graph is the multiplicity of the root 0 of the chromatic polynomial (thus the chromatic polynomial determines whether a graph is connected) and (ii) a disconnected graph is chromatically equivalent to some graph with an isolated vertex. The first statement is well known. For the latter statement, see p. 65 of [Dong]. - _Eric M. Schmidt_, Mar 20 2015"
