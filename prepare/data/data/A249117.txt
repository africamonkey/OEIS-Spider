    "comment": [
        "Let S = {h^6, h >=1} and T = {32*k^6, k >=1}.  Then S and T are disjoint.  The position of n^6 in the ordered union of S and T is A249117(n), and the position of 32*n^6 is A249118(n).  Equivalently, the latter two give the positions of n*2^(2/3) and n*2^(3/2), respectively, when all the numbers h*2^(2/3) and k*2^(3/2) are jointly ranked."
