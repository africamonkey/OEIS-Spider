        "This sequence (together with already present in the OEIS A034602 and A217772) is based on Gary Detlefs' conjecture, which he disclosed to me in a private communication on 3/29/13 and recently he gave me permission to make it public. Specifically he wrote to me the following: \"I have a conjecture which is broader than the one I submitted, having to do with binomial(k*n,n) mod n^3. It appears that binomial(j*k*n,j*n) mod n^3 will be binomial(k*j,j) for n sufficiently large.\"",
        "In effect above conjecture further extends Wolstenholme's and Ljunggren's ideas and could also be expressed as follows: starting with some specific (for any given unchanged values of integers k>0 and j>0) sufficiently large value of n=N and further on for n>N it is true that ((binomial (j*k*prime(n), j*prime(n)) - binomial(k*j, j))/k/(prime(n))^3 = m(j, k, n ), where m(j, k, n ) are integer values.",
        "Note that the values of A034602 are replicated by above general formula for k=2, j=1 and n>=3 and the values of A217772 are replicated by the same formula for k=3, j=1 and n>=2."
