    "comment": [
        "The sequence is finite because only the first digit is considered in defining the entire number. This first digit can vary only between 1 and 9. Hence, the largest possible number must be 9000000000 + p, where p is a 9-digit prime number. The largest prime I have found that fits this category is 999999937, giving the term, 9999999937."
