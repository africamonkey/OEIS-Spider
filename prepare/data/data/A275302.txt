    "comment": [
        "Langton's Ant living on triangular tiling (or, equivalently, hexagonal grid) follows the rules similar to those of the ordinary Langton's ant. On a white cell, turn 60 degrees right, flip the color of the cell, then move forward one unit. On a black cell, turn 60 degrees left, flip the color of the cell, then move forward one unit.",
        "On these iterations pattern becomes symmetric. Orientation of the ant on these iterations is always the same.",
        "Empirically, a(n) ~ c*n^1.207."
