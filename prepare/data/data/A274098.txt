        "There are n players, each player plays all the others, so there are n(n-1)/2 games and 2^(n(n-1)/2) possible outcomes (there are no ties). At the end of the tournament we record the score sequence, which is the partition of n(n-1)/2 into n parts specified by the numbers of victories of the players. Then a(n) is the number of ways the most probable score sequence can occur. The number of different score sequences is given by A000571(n)."
