        "After unfolding the paper, the count consists of (a) triangles whose hypotenuse is parallel to the sides of the original square, (b) triangles whose hypotenuse is diagonal to the sides of the original square, (c) rectangles whose sides are parallel to the sides of the original square and (d) rectangles whose sides are diagonal to the sides of the original square. Note that the count for (c) is A096222(2*(Ceiling(n/2)-1)). E.g. a(5) = 205 because the counts are a=32, b=64, c=100, d=9. - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 09 2004"
