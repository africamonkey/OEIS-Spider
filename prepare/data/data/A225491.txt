        "Frequency depth is defined at A225485.  Suppose S is a multiset on an alphabet y(1),..,y(n).  Let f(n) > 0 be the frequency of y(i) in S, so that F(S) (as at A225485) is the multiset {f(1),..,f(m)}, where m is the number of distinct terms in S.  Let {g(1),..,g(k)} be the set of distinct terms of F(S), and let h(i) be the number of occurrences of g(i) in F(S).  Then F(F(S)) is a partition p(m) of m, and D(F(F(S))) = D(p(m)), where D denotes frequency depth.  To maximize D for n>1, put m = n to get a(n) = 2 + A225486(n), for n > 1."

If 1 <= p < q, then the depth of 4 is the number of arrows when we write S -> pq -> 11 -> 2 -> 1.  The other possibilities (p = 0, or p=q) for p and q lead to depths < 4, so that a(2) = 4."
