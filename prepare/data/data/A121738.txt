        "We include \"1\" for the 1-dimensional trivial representation and we list each dimension once, ignoring the possibility that inequivalent representations may have the same dimension."

    "example": [
        "The highest weight 0000 corresponds to the 1-dimensional module on which F4 acts trivially. The smallest faithful representation of F4 is the \"standard\" representation of dimension 26 (the second term in the sequence), with highest weight 0001. (This representation is typically viewed as the trace zero elements in a 27-dimensional exceptional Jordan algebra.) The adjoint representation has dimension 52 (the third term in the sequence) and highest weight 1000."
