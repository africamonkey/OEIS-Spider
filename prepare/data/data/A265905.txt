        "This sequence is obtained by setting a(1) = 1, and then adding to each previous term a(n-1) the same factorial base representation, but shifted by one factorial digit left. Only when term does not contain any adjacent nonzero digits, like is case with a(4) = \"2001\" or a(7) = \"3004001\", the next term a(5) = \"22011\" (or respectively a(8) = \"33044011\") shows the uncorrupted \"doublevision pattern\". In other cases, like for example when going from a(2) to a(3), \"11\" to \"121\", two nonzero digits are summed up and there is possibly also a carry digit propagating to the left.",
        "Note that the sequence is computed in such a way that also factorial base digits larger than 9 are correctly summed together.
