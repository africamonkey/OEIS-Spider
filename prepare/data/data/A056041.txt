        "a(8)=3*2^(3*2^27+27)-1 which is more than 10^(10^8) and equal to the final base of the Goodstein sequence starting with g(2)=4; indeed, apart from the initial term, the sequence starting with b(2)=8 is identical to the Goodstein sequence starting with g(2)=4. The initial terms of a(n) [2, 3, 5 and 7] are equal to the initial terms of the equivalent final bases of Goodstein sequences starting at the same points. a(9)=2^(2^(2^70+70)+2^70+70)-1 which is more than 10^(10^(10^20)).",

        "Comment from _John Tromp_, Dec 02 2004: The sequence 2,3,5,7,3*2^402653211 - 1, ... gives the final base of the Goodstein sequence starting with n. This is an example of a very rapidly growing function that is total (i.e. defined on any input), although this fact is not provable in first-order Peano Arithmetic. See the links for definitions. This grows even faster than the Friedman sequence described in the Comments to A014221.",
        "In fact there are two related sequences: (i) The Goodstein function l(n) = number of steps for the Goodstein sequence to reach 0 when started with initial term n >= 0: 0, 1, 3, 5, 3*2^402653211 - 3, ...; and (ii) the same sequence + 2: 2, 3, 5, 7, 3*2^402653211 - 1, ..., which is the final base reached. Both grow too rapidly to have their own entries in the database.",
