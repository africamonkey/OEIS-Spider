        "The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.",
        "Generalized Bethe trees are called uniform trees in the Goldberg - Livshits reference.",
        "There is a simple bijection between generalized Bethe trees with n edges and partitions of n in which each part is divisible by the next (the parts are given by the number of edges at the successive levels). We have the correspondences: number of edges --- sum of parts; root degree --- last part; number of leaves --- first part; height --- number of parts."
