    "comment": [
        "These numbers are the odd D candidates for the (generalized) Pell equation x^2 - D*y^2 = +8 which could have proper solutions (x, y) with x and y both odd (and gcd(x, y) = 1).",
        "Proof: Put x =2*X + 1, y = 2*Y + 1; then 8*(T(X) - D*T(Y)) = 8 - 1 + D = 7 + D, with the triangular numbers T = A000217. Hence, D == -7 (mod 8) == +1 (mod 8). Only nonsquare numbers D are considered for the Pell equation (square D leads to a factorization with only one solution: D = 1, (x, y) = (3, 1)). Consider a prime factor p == 3 or 5 (mod 8) (A007520 or A007521) of D. Then x^2 == 8 (mod p). Because the Legendre symbol (8/p) = (2*2^2/p) = (2/p) ==  (-1)^(p^2-1)/8 (see, e.g., Nagell, eq. (3), p. 138) this becomes -1 for these primes p, and therefore a candidate for D cannot have any prime factors 3 or 5 (mod 8).",
        "However, not all of these candidates admit solutions. For the exceptions see A264348.",
        "The remaining Ds (that admit solutions) are given in A263012."
