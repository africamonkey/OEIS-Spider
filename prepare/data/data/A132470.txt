        "Both this sequence and A051728 should be checked. There are two possibilities for confusion in each case. In defining f(m), does one allow or exclude m itself, in case m is a prime? In defining a(n), does one require (here) that f(m) = 3n or only that >= 3n, or (in A051728) that f(m) = 2n or only >= 2n? Probably there should be several sequences, to include all the possibilities in each case. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 18 2007. Added Nov 20 2007: _R. J. Mathar_ has now clarified the definition of the present sequence.",
