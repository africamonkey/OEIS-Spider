        "The terms >=31 are only conjectures found by numerical experimentation. In the table given at the Pfoertner link, the densities are given relative to the density of the cubic lattice packing (Pi/6). The first known arrangement with higher density than that of the cubic lattice packing was found for m=31 spheres. In the region 8<m<27 increasing packing densities occur for m=9,13,14. m=14 comes very close (0.994949) to the cubic lattice packing density."
