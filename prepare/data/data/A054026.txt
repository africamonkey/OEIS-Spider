    "comment": [
        "There are 14 ways to put parentheses in the expression a - b - c - d - e: ((a - (b - c)) - d) - e, (((a - b) - c) - d) - e, ((a - b) - (c - d)) - e, etc. This sequence describes how many sets of natural numbers [a,b,c,d,e] can be produced with the numbers {0,1,2,3,...n} such that the values of all the distinct expressions are different."
