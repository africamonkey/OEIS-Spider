        "When the multiplier in the recurrence is 2, we have the Graham-Pollak sequence, where there is a remarkable exact explicit formula for a(n) in terms of the union of the set of integers and the set of integer multiples of Sqrt(2). As Weisstein summarizes Borwein & Bailey: \"It is not known if sequences such as a(n) = Floor(Sqrt(3*a(n-1)*(a(n-1)+1))) have corresponding properties.\" This sequence is the given one, with a(0) = 1. Through n=40, the primes are when n = 1, 3, 6, 9, 14, 25, 28, 29. Through n=40, the semiprimes are when n = 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 21, 22, 26, 27, 30, 31, 38."
