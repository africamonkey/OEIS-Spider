        "Mark Underwood found that for each nonnegative integer n < 1421 there is at least one prime of the form 2^m + 3^n or 2^n + 3^m with m not exceeding n.",
        "This sequence consists of numbers for which there is no such prime.",
        "David Broadhurst estimated that a fraction in excess of 1/800 of the natural numbers belongs to this sequence and found 17 instances with n < 10^4.",
        "For each of the remaining 9983 nonnegative integers n < 10^4, a prime or probable prime of the form 2^x + 3^y was found with max(x,y) = n.",
        "Each probable prime was subjected to a combination of strong Fermat and strong Lucas tests."
