        "The recursions were found by examining empirical data and have not been proved to be accurate for all n. The generating function was found by assuming that the recursions were accurate; it can be calculated from either recursion. We created a specialized program in Java for finding the sequences of generations for triangles with angles {pi/p, pi/q, pi/r}, p, q, r > 1, that tile the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane; this program was used to calculate the sequence.",
