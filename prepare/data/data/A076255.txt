        "A floor exponential prime sequence (FEPS) is a sequence of the form {a(n) = floor[t^n]:1<=n<=length} in which t is a real number greater than or equal to 2 and each term in the sequence is prime. FEPS(len,k) is the k-th maximal optimal floor exponential prime sequence of length len, ordered by exponent t = a(len)^(1/len). As far as I know, the only previously known FEPS was FEPS(8,1) = {2, 5, 13, 31, 73, 173, 409, 967} (first 8 terms of A063636). During the past few days I've discovered 20 others with length up to 92, including 16 of length up to 27 which I know to be the first such sequence of given length.",
        "I found that past the first nine members, the only other powers of t which produce a prime are 15, 79 & 101 and no others <= 2500. - _Robert G. Wilson v_"
