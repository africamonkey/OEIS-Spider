        "A squared rectangle (which may be a square) is a rectangle dissected into a finite number, two or more, of squares. If no two of these squares have the same size the squared rectangle is perfect. The order of a squared rectangle is the number of constituent squares. By convention the sides of the subsquares are integers with no common factor.",
        "A squared rectangle is simple if it does not contain a smaller squared rectangle. Every perfect square with the largest known side length for each order up to 33 is simple.",
