        "In the normal sieve of Eratosthenes, for a given number p, we cross out all multiples of p; that is, p, p + p, p + p + p, ....  In this decaying sieve, we cross out p, p + (p-1), p + (p-1) + (p-2), ..., p + (p-1) + (p-2) + ... + 1 (a finite list of p numbers). The sequence gives those values which are not crossed out by a sum initiated by a lesser integer. They are the \"primes\" of this decaying sieve.",
        "Geometrical interpretation: in the sieve of Eratosthenes, each surviving integer p can be seen as eliminating those numbers that enumerate a rectangular area dot pattern one side of which has length p. In this sieve, each surviving integer k eliminates each number that enumerates a trapezoidal area dot pattern (on a triangular grid) with longest side k, plus the limiting case of the triangular area dot pattern with side k (the k-th triangular number). - _Peter Munn_, Jan 05 2017",
        "If such a pattern has m dots, the possible lengths (number of dots) for the longest side are the nonzero numbers that occur in row m of A286013 after the number m in column 1. Thus m is in this sequence if and only if none of the other numbers in row m of A286013 are in this sequence. - _Peter Munn_, Jun 18 2017"
