    "comment": [
        "Write the sorted list of all prime factors of each integer k (with multiplicity) underneath, with one prime per row. If there is one prime factor with one digit, one prime factor with 2 digits, one with three, one with four etc, the tight hull/circumference of the digits looks like an equilateral triangle, and the integer k is added to the sequence. This implies that multiplicities of the prime factors of these k need to be 1 (as in A005117).",
        "We can replace the digits in the stack by dots; if the requirement on the smooth variation in the digit counts is met, the total number of dots is a triangular number A000217.",
        "Conjecture: The number of terms in this sequence is infinite. While this may be true, there are large gaps with no occurrences of factor triangles. Between 700 and 2000 there are no numbers that form factor triangles."
