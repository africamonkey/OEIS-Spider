        "Because x^3-y^3 = (x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2), the difference of two cubes is a prime number only if x=y+1, in which case all the primes are cuban, see A002407.",
        "The difference can be a square (see A038597), but Fermat's Last Theorem prevents the difference from ever being a cube. Beal's Conjecture implies that there are no higher odd powers in this sequence.",
