        "\"Semiprimes with even digits are less numerous than those with odd digits\" because (base 10): no integer after 10 can end in a 0 without being divisible by 2, 5 and at least one other prime; for a semiprime to end in 2, 4, 6, or 8 it must be divisible by 2 and a prime with almost as many digits as the semiprime (and primes get rarer as they get longer); no semiprime with all even digits after 22 can be a repdigit; and similar constraints. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Nov 07 2005"
