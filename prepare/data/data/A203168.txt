        "In the Gauss-Kuzmin distribution, 1 appears with probability lg 4/3 = 41.5037...%. Thus the n-th appearance of 1 in the continued fraction of a real number chosen uniformly from [0, 1) will be, with probability 1, n / (lg 4/3) + O(sqrt(n)). Does this sequence have the same asymptotic? - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Dec 30 2011"
