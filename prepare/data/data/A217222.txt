Note that in all cases \"9th term\" (in this case 8143+2=8145) is divisible by 9 and hence is not semiprime. Also note that all seven \"intermediate\" even integers (in this case {8130, 8132, 814, 8136, 8138, 8140, 8142}) have at least three prime factors counting with multiplicity. Up to n = 40*10^9 there are 5570 terms of this sequence."
