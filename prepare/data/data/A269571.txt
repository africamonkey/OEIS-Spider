        "For each x in (0,1], let 1/2^p(1) + 1/2^p(2) + ... be the infinite binary representation of x. Let d(1) = p(1) and d(i) = p(i) - p(i-1) for i >=2. Call (d(i)) the powerdifference sequence of x, and denote it by D(x). Call m/n and u/v equivalent if every period of D(m/n) is a period of D(u/v). Define the binary fractility of n to be the number of distinct equivalence classes of {m/n: 0 < m < n}."
