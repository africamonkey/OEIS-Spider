        "The structure looks like a tree which arises from one of the four spokes of the structure of the cellular automaton of A267190.",
        "a(n) is the total number of ON cells after n-th stage.",
        "For n >> 1 the structure looks like a square which is rotated 45 degrees.",
        "First differs from A161336 at a(17), where A161336 is a version of A161330 (the snowflake cellular automaton).",
        "First differs from A266534 at a(16), where A266534 is a version of A151895.",
        "First differs from A266536 at a(13), where A266536 is a version of A170896 (the Schrandt-Ulam cellular automaton).",
        "From _Omar E. Pol_, Oct 16 2017: (Start)",
        "The graph of both A266536 and this sequence are very similar.",
        "For n >> 1, it appears that A266534(n) < A161336(n) < a(n) < A266536(n).",
        "The graphs of these four sequences are similar, and the behavior looks like percolation.",
        "It appears that there are no recurrences in these four sequences. Thus it appears that there are no recurrences in A151895, A161330, A267190 and A170896. (End)"
