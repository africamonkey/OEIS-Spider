        "Conjecture: 0 and 3844 are the only squares in this sequence.",
        "There are only finitely many squares in the sequence because for some square big enough the offset to the next square is greater than 9^9. Now, for each number d = (largest digit of n)^(smallest digit of n) we just have to walk through the squares, check if this square has the correct (largest digit of n)^(smallest digit of n) property and added d is also a square. I have done that search computation exhaustively (using a PARI program). There are no more squares. -  Maon Wenders, Jun 02 2012",
