        "The discriminator of the factorials is A208494 (replacing a(1) by 1), and the compressed discriminator is defined by reducing blocks of equal/repeated terms to a single instance. Because the discriminator is a monotonously growing sequence, the compressed discriminator is just the records transform of the discriminator. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 11 2016"
