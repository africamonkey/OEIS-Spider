        "Pikhurko writes about the Turan function ex(n; F), which is the maximum number of edges in an F-free graph on n vertices. The question of estimating this function for F = C_2k, the cycle of length 2k, is one of the central open questions in this area that goes back to the 1930s. We know ex(n; C_4) exactly when n = q^2 + q + 1 for any prime power q >= 16 (Furedi, 1983, 1996)."
