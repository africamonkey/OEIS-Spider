        "This sequence is a subset of A003424. The other sequence belonging to A003424 is A023195. These primes are very rare: only eight primes of this form don't exceed 1.275*10^10. They are all in this sequence (see Bateman and Stemmler):",
        "  (1) three of the form (p^9 - 1)/(p^3 - 1); they are: {73 (p=2), 757 (p=3), 1772893 (p=11)},",
        "  (2) four of the form (2^x - 1)/(2^y - 1) with x = 2y; they are: {5 (x=4), 17 (x=8), 257 (x=16), 65537 (x=32)},",
