        "Or, even integers k such that k + p is composite for all primes p, q with p + q = k.",
        "The two initial terms vacuously satisfy the definition, but all even numbers >= 4 are the sum of two primes, according to the Goldbach conjecture.",
        "All odd numbers except for numbers m such that m-2 and m+2 are prime (= A087679) would satisfy the definition. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 05 2017",
        "Conjecture: except for a(4)=6, all terms are coprime to 3. - _Bob Selcoe_, Apr 06 2017",
        "If E is an even number not divisible by 3, then E is in the sequence unless E-3 and at least one of E+3 and 2E-3 are prime. - _Robert Israel_, Apr 10 2017",
        "Consider a subsequence with the additional condition: n+odd part of p-1 is composite (for example, for p=19 it is 9). I found that this subsequence begins 0,2,118 and up to 300000 _Peter J. C. Moses_ found only more one term 868. Is this subsequence finite? - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 12 2017",
        "One can compare the theoretical maxima with the actual sequence numbers of terms.  Doing this at powers of 10, we see at powers {2,3,4,5,6} the ratio progression {2.33,1.51,1.25,1.15,1.096}.  This implies that the excluded even numbers become increasingly rare (those coprime to 3). - _Bill McEachen_, Apr 17 2017",
        "From Robert Israel's comment and the distribution of primes, the proportion of even numbers not divisible by 3 that are in the sequence tends to 1. - _Peter Munn_, Apr 23 2017",
        "Moreover, If n is not divisible by 3 and 2*n - 3 is composite, then 2*n+p is also composite. Indeed, for these 2*n all primes p such that 2*n-p is prime are in the interval (3, 2*n-3). Then either 2*n-p or 2*n+p should be divisible by 3, but 2*n-p is prime >3. So 2*n+p is composite and 2*n is in the sequence. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 28 2017"
