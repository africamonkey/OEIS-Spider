    "comment": [
        "Erd\u0151s and Straus conjectured that for all integers n >= 2, the rational number 4/n can be expressed as an Egyptian fraction with exactly three unit fractions -- that is, 4/n = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z where x, y and z are positive integers. The conjecture has been verified to high values of n, and Mordell has provided formulas to compute x, y and z for many n. The values of n NOT included in Mordell's formulas are those for which n modulo 840 = {an element of this sequence}. Each element is the square of a prime."
