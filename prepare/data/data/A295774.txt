        "A planar additive basis for the square [0,2n]^2 is a set of points with nonnegative integer coordinates such that their pairwise sums cover the square. Self-sums are allowed. In a restricted basis all points are in the lower left quadrant [0,n]^2.",
        "Matches A008574 at least up to a(23)=92."
