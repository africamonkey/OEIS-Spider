        "Also, total number of cubic ON cells after n generations in a three-dimensional cellular automaton in which A169707(n) gives the number of cubic ON cells in the n-th level of the structure starting from the top. The structure looks like an irregular step pyramid. Note that there are two versions of this pyramid because there are two versions of the structure of the cellular automaton of A169707. - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 17 2015"
