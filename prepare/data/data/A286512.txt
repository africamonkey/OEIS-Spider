        "The set of these numbers appears to be finite, and probably 2781 is its largest element.",
        "The motivation for this sequence is the study of the behaviour of the sum of digits of powers of a given number. Statistically, sumdigits(n^k) ~ 4.5*log_10(n')*k (where n' = n without trailing 0's), but typically fluctuations of some percent persist up to large values of k. (Cf. the graph of sequences n^k cited in the cross-references.)",
        "The ratio of 11/10 is somewhat arbitrary, but larger ratios of the simple form (1 + 1/m) yield quite small subsets of this sequence (for m=2 the only element is 118, for m=3 the set is {31, 86, 118}, for m=1 it is empty), and smaller ratios yield much larger (possibly infinite?) sets. Also, the condition can be written sumdigits(N^k)-N > N/10, and 10 is the base we are using.",
        "To compute the sequence A247889 we would like to have a rule telling us when we can stop the search for an exponent. It appears that sumdigits(N^k) >= 2*N is a limit that works for all N, the present sequence gives counter-examples to the (r.h.s.) limit of 1.1*N. The above comment mentioned the counter-examples {118} resp. {31, 86, 118}) for limits N*3/2 and N*4/3."
