        "Goldston-Graham-Pintz-Yildirim prove that this sequence is infinite; in particular infinitely often a(k) = A189982(n) = A189982(n+1) - 1. In fact, their proof shows that at least one of the residue classes 355740n + 47480, 889350n + 118700, or 592900n + 79134 contains infinitely many terms of this sequence."
