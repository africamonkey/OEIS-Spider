        "By Lucas' theorem, binomial(2n,n) is not divisible by a prime p iff all base-p digits of n are smaller than p/2.",
        "Ronald L. Graham (graham(AT)ucsd.edu) offers $1000 to the first person who can settle the question of whether this sequence is finite or infinite. He remarks that heuristic arguments show that it should be infinite, but finite if it is required that binomial(2n,n) is prime to 3, 5, 7 and 11, with n = 3160 probably the last n which has this property.",
        "The Erd\u0151s et al. paper shows that for any two odd primes p and q there are an infinite number of n for which gcd(p*q,binomial(2n,n))=1; i.e., p and q do not divide binomial(2n,n). The paper does not deal with the case of three primes. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 18 2007",
