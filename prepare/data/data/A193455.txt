        "This sequence is the solution to the following problem: \"Suppose you have the choice of using one of three production options: apply a simple action, bundle all existing actions (which requires p=3 steps), or apply the current bundled action. The first use of a novel bundle erases (or makes obsolete) all prior actions.  How many total actions (simple) can be applied in n time steps?\"",
        "1. This problem is structurally similar to the Copy and Paste Keyboard problem: Existing sequences (A178715 and A193286) should be regarded as Paradigm-Shift Sequences with Procedural Lengths p=1 and 2, respectively.",
