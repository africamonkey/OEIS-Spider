The sequence b'(n) is the complement to 1 of the sequence f(n) defined in A167424 by f(1) = 1/2 and f(n+1) = (f(n)^2 + 1)/2, i.e., b'(n) + f(n) = 1. The numerator of b'(n) is given by a'(n) = 2^(2^n-1)*b'(n).",

        "The following is the counterpart of a comment in A167424. Suppose that U_1, U_2, ... is a sequence of independent uniform (0,1) random variables, and define random variables X_1, X_2, ... as follows: X_1 = U_1, and, for n >= 1, X_{n+1} = X_n or U_{n+1} according as U_{n+1} > E(X_n) or U_{n+1} < E(X_n), respectively, where E() denotes expectation. Then, the sequence E(X_n) is identical to the sequence b'(n) introduced in the comment dated Mar 17 2010. Sketch of proof. E(X_1) = 1/2; for n >= 1, by the law of total expectation, we have E(X_{n+1}) = (1 - E(X_n))*E(X_n) + E(X_n)*E(X_n)/2. Hence E(X_{n+1}) = E(X_n) - E(X_n)^2/2. (End)",
