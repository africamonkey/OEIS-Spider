        "All primes p are in the sequence since the only pair of divisors of p is {1, p} and since the smallest p = 2 has more bits than 1; all larger primes written in binary will require at least 2 bits to represent p. Thus A000040 is a subsequence of this sequence. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Dec 30 2015"
