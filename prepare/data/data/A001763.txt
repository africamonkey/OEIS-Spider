        "With offset 1, a(n) = number of labeled plane trees (A006963) on n vertices in which vertices of degree d come in d colors or, equivalently, each vertex has a favorite neighbor (n>=2). For example, there are 2 unlabeled plane trees with 4 vertices: the path and the star. There are 4!/2 ways to label the path and 4!/3 ways to label the star. There are 4 choices for coloring vertices in the path and 3 choices for coloring vertices in the star. The count for 4 vertices is thus 12*4 + 8*3 = 72. [_David Callan_, Aug 22 2014]"
