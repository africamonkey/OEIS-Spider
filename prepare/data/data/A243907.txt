The 50 stars are placed in a rectangular grid with outside dimensions six stars wide by five stars high, but they could also be placed in a grid 17 stars wide by two stars high. This sequence lists, up to 200 stars, all numbers of stars that could be placed in a rectangular field in more than one arrangement.",
