    "comment": [
        "Partitions are considered as generalized Ferrers diagrams; any permutation of the axes produces a conjugate. An infinite-dimensional partition thus has infinitely many conjugates. However, an infinite-dimensional partition of n always has a conjugate of dimension at most n-2, so this sequence is always finite."
