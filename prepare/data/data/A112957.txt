        "This is to A000283 as a tribonacci (A000213) is to Fibonacci. Two oddities about his sequence: (a) its first 7 terms are identical to terms numbered 2 through 8 of A072878; (b) only one of the first 9 terms are composite. Primes in the sequence begin 3, 11, 131, 17291 and 89398586189293211. What is the next prime?"
