        "For any prime p_i, there are as many squarefree numbers having p_i as a factor as squarefree numbers not having p_i as a factor amongst all the squarefree numbers (one-to-one correspondance, both cardinality aleph_0).",
        "E.g. there are as many even squarefree numbers as there are odd squarefree numbers.",
        "For any prime p_i, the density of squarefree numbers having p_i as a factor is 1/p_i of the density of squarefree numbers not having p_i as a factor.",
        "E.g. the density of even squarefree numbers is 1/p_i = 1/2 of the density of odd squarefree numbers (which means that 1/(p_i + 1) = 1/3 of the squarefree numbers are even and p_i/(p_i + 1) = 2/3 are odd) and as a consequence the n-th even squarefree number is very nearly p_i = 2 times the n-th odd squarefree number (which means that the n-th even squarefree number is very nearly (p_i + 1) = 3 times the n-th squarefree number while the n-th odd squarefree number is very nearly (p_i + 1)/ p_i = 3/2 the n-th squarefree number.",
        "For any prime p_i, the n-th squarefree number odd to p_i (not divisible by p_i) is: n * ((p_i + 1)/p_i) * zeta(2) + O(n^(1/2)) = n * (p_i + 1)/p_i) * (pi^2 / 6) + O(n^(1/2)) (End)",
