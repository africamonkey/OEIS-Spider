    "comment": [
        "Finite? There are no more terms up to base 40. A probabilistic argument says higher bases are increasingly unlikely to produce a value.",
        "There is no further term up to base=56; and no solution for base=60. Furthermore all bases are even: if the number formed by the first (base-1) digits is x, then x is divisible by (base-1) and x==base*(base-1)/2 mod (base-1), because the base-th digit is zero. From this the base is even. We can also see that if the i-th leftmost digit is d, then gcd(base,i)=gcd(base,d). To see this let g=gcd(base,i) and the number formed by the first i digit is x, then i divides x=k*base+d for some k, from this g divides d. And obviously g divides base, so g divides gcd(base,d), but it can't be larger than g, otherwise say gcd(base,d)=h>g, then in every h-th position we see a digit divisible by h, and the i-th digit is also divisible by h. This is a contradiction, there would be more than base/h digits divisible by h. - _Robert Gerbicz_, Mar 15 2016"
