The number b(n) of such trees on n vertices satisfies the recurrence b[1]=1; b[n_]/;n>=2 := b[n] = b[n-1] + Sum_{i=1..floor((n-1)/2)} b[i]b[n-1-i], the first term counting trees whose root has outdegree 1 and the sum counting trees whose root has outdegree 2 by size of the left subtree. This recurrence generates b(n) = a(n+1), n >= 1. For example, the a(5)=3 such trees are:",
