        "Not divided by 4 because that property may not continue.",
        "Each partition is counted twice in this sequence. The sequence can be computed by counting Hamiltonian paths on a n-1 x n-1 grid that start at any vertex on the grid boundary and terminate at another boundary vertex. Counts for whether the path starts or terminates on a corner or non-corner need to be computed separately as there are different multiplication factors. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Apr 13 2016"
