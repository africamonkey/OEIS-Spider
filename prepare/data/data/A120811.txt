        "This sequence (A120811) is a generalization of twin prime (A001359), the sequence A120776 is a generalization of Sophie Germain prime (A005384), while A120806 is the generalization of Sophie germain twin prime (A045536). The same observations apply to A120811 as to A120806: the elements are (a) twin primes, (b) semiprimes pq, (c) 3-almost-primes, (d) 4-almost-primes. Moreover, the sequence includes all twin primes but in (b), (c) and (d) the containments are proper. The first occurrence of (d) is A120811(3980)=3^3*13147. Any others? A120811 CONJECTURE: These are all the elements, that is, no element of A120811 has more than 3 prime factors with no degree (sum of exponents) higher than 4."
