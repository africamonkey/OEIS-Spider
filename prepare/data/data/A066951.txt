        "Up to five edges, every planar graph can be drawn with edges of length 1, so up to this point the sequence agrees with A046091 (connected planar graphs with n edges) [except for the fact that that sequence begins with no edges]. For six edges, the only graphs that cannot be drawn with edges of length 1 are K_4 and K_{3,2}. According to A046091, there are 30 connected planar graphs with 6 edges, so the sixth term is 28."
