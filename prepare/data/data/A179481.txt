        "Question. Is every term of this sequence prime?",
        "From _Gary W. Adamson_, Sep 04 2012: (Start)",
        "In answer to the primality question and pursuant to the Coach Theorem of Hilton and Pedersen: phi(b) = 2 * k * c, with b an odd integer and k in A003558, and c (the numbers of coaches) in A135303; iff phi(b) = (b-1) then b = p, prime. This implies that if b has one coach and k = (b-1)/2, b must be prime since phi(b) = 2 * k * c = 2 * (b-1)/2 * 1 = (b-1).  Conjectures: all terms in A179481 have one coach with k = (b-1)/2 and are therefore primes.  Next, if A179480(n) is a new record high value, then so is A003558(n-1); but not necessarily the converse (e.g. 13), and the corresponding value of k for b is (b-1)/2.  Examples: b = 13 has one coach with k (sum of bottom row terms ) = 6 = A003558(6); and r (number of entries in each row) = 3:",
        "13:  [1, 3, 5]",
        "......2, 1, 3. This example satisfies the primality requirements since phi(13) = 12 = 2 * k * c = 2 * 6 * 1; but not the new record requirement for r = 3 since A179480(6) = 3, corresponding to 11, not l3.  As shown in the coach for 11:",
        "11:  [1, 3, 3]",
        "......1, 1, 3; k = (b-1)/2 with r = 3 and c = 1. Therefore, 11 is in A179481 but not 13. (End)"
