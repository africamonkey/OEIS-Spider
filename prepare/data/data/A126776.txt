        "a(8) > 209000. Abstract: \"We give a short survey on computational techniques which can be used to solve the representation conversion problem for polyhedra up to symmetries. We in particular discuss decomposition methods, which reduce the problem to a number of lower dimensional subproblems. These methods have been successfully used by different authors in special contexts. Moreover, we sketch an incremental method, which is a generalization of Fourier-Motzkin elimination and we give some ideas how symmetry can be exploited using pivots.\""
