        "These numbers are half the sum of powers of 2 indexed by differences of a triangular number and each smaller triangular number (e.g., 21 - 15 = 6, 21 - 10 = 11, ..., 21 - 0 = 21).",
        "This suggests another way to think about these numbers: consider the number triangle formed by the characteristic function of the triangular numbers (A010054), join together the first n rows (the very first row is row 0) as a single binary string and that gives the (n + 1)th term of this sequence. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 15 2013"
