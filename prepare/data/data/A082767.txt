        "The prime graph is defined to be the graph formed by writing the integers 0 to n in a straight line as vertices and then connecting i and j (i>j) iff i-j=1 or i=j+p, where p is a prime factor of i. It can be visualized as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, with each integer connected to its neighbors and the striking out process as a wave forming the remaining edges."
