        "Sequence corresponds to the maximum chain length of a variant of the classical puzzle whereby, under agreed terms, a ringed golden chain asset of a(n) links, when judiciously fragmented into n opened links (through n cuts) and n pieces of lengths (2n+1), (2n+1)*3, (2n+1)*3^2, ..., (2n+1)*3^(n-1), may be used to sequentially settle for payment equivalent up to a(n)-link cost, a link-cost at a time, with swapping allowed with identical fragments owned by the creditor."
