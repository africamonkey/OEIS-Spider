    "comment": [
        "The partition graph G(n) is defined at A241150 as follows:  the nodes are the partitions of n, and nodes p and q have an edge if one of them can be obtained from the other by a substitution x -> x-1,1 for some part x. Let R be the set of partitions (nodes) of n that contain a repeated part and let E be the set of edges of G(n) that have a node in R.  Removing R and E from G(n) leaves a graph G'(n) whose nodes are the strict partitions of n, as in A000009.  (The 2nd Mathematica program at A241900 shows G'(n) for n up to 20.)"

The largest component has 6 nodes, so that a(10) = 6."
