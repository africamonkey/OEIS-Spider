        "It is easy to show that A081399(n) is between n/log(n) and 2n/log(n) (for n>n0), cf. [Campbell 1984]. This sequence A137687 is roughly the middle of this interval (with log(n) replaced by log(n+2) to be well-defined for all n>=0), which turns out to be a fair (and simple, increasing) approximation for A081399.",
        "See A137686 for the (signed) difference of the two sequences."
