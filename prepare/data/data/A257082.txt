        "The initial pattern consists of 6 straight line segments which are the radii of a hexagon. The next generations are scaled down by a factor of tan(Pi/6) and rotated by an angle of Pi/6. Their free ends are the ends of elements that do not contact or cross the other ones. Overlaps among different generations are prohibited. See illustration in the links."
