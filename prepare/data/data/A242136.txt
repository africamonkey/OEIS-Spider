Four have a central vertex joined to all 4 vertices of the square creating 4 triangular regions, one of which contains the second interior vertex. In these 4 cases, the central vertex has degree 5, the other interior  vertex has degree 3. In the other 2 triangulations, both interior vertices have degree 4, an opposite pair a, c of vertices of the square both have degree 3 (so 1 interior edge), and the other 2 opposite vertices have degree 4."
