        "A squared rectangle (which may be a square) is a rectangle dissected into a finite number, two or more, of integer sized squares. If no two of these squares have the same size the squared rectangle is perfect. A squared rectangle is simple if it does not contain a smaller squared rectangle. The order of a squared rectangle is the number of constituent squares.  This sequence counts simple perfect squared rectangles and simple imperfect squared rectangles."
