        "Andreas Weingartner used the first 913685 terms of this sequence to prove that the equation sigma(n)= sigma(n+k) has at least one solution for every even k in the range 2 <= k <= 10^(10^7). The upper bound is just lower than the product of 2a(n)+1 of these terms which equals 3.222... * 10^10000007."
