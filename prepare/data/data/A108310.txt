        "Note that log(n#)=theta(n) (the Chebyshev function) for which bounds are known (e.g. Rosser and Schoenfeld have an estimate |theta(n)-n| < n/(40 log n).) In particular, log(n#)/n tends to 1, which allows a proof of the Prime Number Theorem. I suspect log(n#) can be greater than n for some n, which would make the sequence finite, but I do not know an example of such an n. (When n=30337841, 0.9999 < log(n#)/n < 1.)",

        "Computational experiments show that it may be true that n > log(n#) for all n. In fact, it appears that, for any k, n > log(n#) + k*log(n) except for a finite number of small primes. For k=1, only 5, 7 and 19 are the exceptional n. This inequality is still consistent with 1 being the limiting value of log(n#)/n. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 17 2006",
        "Apparently in the long run (n-theta(n))/(Li(n)-Pi(n)) goes to log(n), so if Li(n)<Pi(n), which will happen before 1.4x10^316, then clearly there are values n for which n<theta(n). (According to my calculations, theta(n) will surpass n even a while before Pi(n) surpasses Li(n).) - _Martin Raab_, May 13 2008",
        "Sequence is finite since psi(x) - x is greater than sqrt x * log log log x infinitely often, and hence theta(x) > x infinitely often [but theta(x) - x = o(x), see Rosser & Schoenfeld]. See Hardy & Littlewood section 5. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Aug 02 2012"
