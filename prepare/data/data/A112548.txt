        "In 1911 Ramanujan believed that the numerator of Bernoulli(n)/n for n even was (apart from sign) always either 1 or a prime. This is false.",
        "Equivalently, n such that the numerator of zeta(1-n) is prime. No other n<23000. Kellner's Calcbn program was used to generate the numerators of Bernoulli(k)/k for k>5000. Mathematica and PFGW were used to test for probable primes. David Broadhurst found n=4306, which yields a 10342-digit probable prime. For n<4306, the primes have been proved. Bouk de Water proved the prime for n=1870. All these primes are necessarily irregular.",
