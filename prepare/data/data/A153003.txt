        "At stage 0, we start from a vertical half toothpick at [(0,0),(0,1)]. This half toothpick represents one of the two components of the first toothpick placed in the toothpick structure of A139250, so a(0) = 0.",
        "At stage 1, we place an orthogonal toothpick of length 2 centered at the end, so a(1) = 1. Also we place half toothpick at [(0,-1),(1,-1)]. This last half toothpick represents one of the two components of the third toothpick placed in the toothpick structure of A139250.",
        "At stage 2, we place three toothpicks, so a(2) = 1+3 = 4.",
        "In each subsequent stage, for every exposed toothpick end, place an orthogonal toothpick centered at that end.",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n stages. A153004 (the first differences) gives the number of toothpicks added to the structure at n-th stage.",
        "Note that this sequence is different from the toothpick \"corner\" sequence A153006. For more information see A139250. (End)"
