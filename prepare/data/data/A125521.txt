    "formula": [
        "If n is even, a(n) is 6 followed by (n - 2) / 2 zeros. If n is odd, a(n) is 3 followed by (n - 1) / 2 zeros."

        "a(3) = 30. If one types 595 into a calculator and rotates it 180 degrees, they will get 565. 595 - 565 = 30. With a little thought, it is provable that 30 is the smallest possible difference."
