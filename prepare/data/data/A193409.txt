        "For n>9 the structure of digits represent a crater. The first and last digit of numbers are identical. The first digits are in consecutive decreasing order. The last digits are in consecutive increasing order. The numbers have only one smallest digit. The number of digits is odd. This sequence is finite with 55 terms. The last term is 9876543210123456789.",
