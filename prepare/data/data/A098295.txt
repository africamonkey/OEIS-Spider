        "Stacking perfect fifths (the frequency ratio of a fifth is 3/2), a division by 2^a(n) leads the equivalent tone belonging to the first octave interval [1,2). For example, the third fifth, (3/2)^3, falls into the second octave. This means it lies in the interval [2^1,2^2)=[2,4). Hence ((3/2)^3)/2^1 belongs to the first octave, the interval [1,2).",
        "This sequence coincides for the first 93 term with the floor of y(n)= 4*Pi*log(phi)*n/(Pi^2 + (2*log(phi)^2)), with phi:=(1+sqrt(5))/2. a(n) = floor(y(n)), for n=1..93. Note that y(n) is not the imaginary part of the zero of the Fibonacci function because of a different bracket setting. See A214656. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jul 24 2012"
