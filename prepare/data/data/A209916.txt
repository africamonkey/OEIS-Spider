    "comment": [
        "This sequence shows the number of distinct patterns that can be created with threads of 2 colors while sewing on a button with n buttonholes located on the vertices of a generic convex n-gon, i.e., a convex n-gon with no more than two diagonals intersecting at any point in its interior. The number of all distinct patterns due to intersections made by differently colored diagonals of the n-gon, equaling 2^A000332(n), is taken into account (as red-diagonal-over-green-diagonal, for instance, is a different pattern from green-diagonal-over-red-diagonal). In general, if the number of colors is c, then a(n) = ((c+1)^(n-1)*n/2)*((c-1)*c)^A000332(n)-1.",
