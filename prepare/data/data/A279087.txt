    "comment": [
        "A049363(n), the smallest number that is pandigital in base n, provides a lower bound. A049363(n)^2 is also pandigital in base n at n = {2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 17}, but nowhere else up to 5000, and of these, A049363(n)^3 is pandigital in base n only at n = 2 and 5. A049363(2)^j = 2^j is clearly pandigital in base 2 for every j > 0 (as its binary expansion is simply a one followed by j zeros), and A049363(5)^j = 694^j seems nearly certain to be pandigital in base 5 for all j > 0. (That 694^j is pandigital in base 5 has been confirmed for every positive j up through 10^6.)"
