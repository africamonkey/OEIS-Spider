        "See A168342. Must be included in A167268. From right to left, first vertical is A168380 from 1 to 8. Second vertical is A168380-1. In (1) page 12, introducing elements  93 to 120, Janet says that there is a probable 8th row. For row 8, he proposes, like for row 7, 32 elements (89 to 120). Page 16 he presents 4 blocks: first has 2*8 elements, second: 6*6, third: 10*4, fourth: 14*2. Today, blocks are s,p,d,f for Mendeleyev-Moseley-Seaborg 118 elements periodic table. See (2), (3), A173592 and A138509. In 1927, only 88 on the first 92 elements were known; 41 (1937 discovered), 61 (1947), 85 (1940) and 87 (1939) were missing. Since 2010 (117 discovered) the first 118 elements are known. Janet predicted only 120 elements."
