    "comment": [
        "SNUSP is a programming language where each command is an individual letter. The four of concern here are +, -, @ and #. + increments the current data value, - decrements it, @ is a \"subroutine call\" and # is a \"return\". When an @ is encountered, a record of the location is put on a stack and execution continues. When a # is encountered, if there is a return point on the stack, the execution continues at that a single character beyond that return point. If there is no return point on the stack, execution terminates.",
        "Thus \"@@++#\" would put the first two \"@\" return points on the stack, increment data twice, return from the second \"@\" to the last \"+\", increment the data once more, return from the first \"@\" to the first \"+\", increment the data two more times and finally terminate when it hits the \"#\" with no return points on the stack. The data is always initialized to zero so this effectively puts 5 into the data. In order to place a particular value into the data, there is a minimal string of these characters. In some cases, allowing the '-' command can shorten this minimal string. This sequence is a list of numbers which require a - in their minimal sequence. All the numbers represented in the above sequence save at most 2 characters by allowing the -. Whether this is a maximum savings and whether the savings can be arbitrarily large is not known (at least not to me)."

    "example": [
        "Using both + and -, 25 can be represented as @-@@@+++# but if we only allow +, the minimal program is @++@@++++# so we only need 8 characters if we allow both + and - but 9 if we allow only + so that 25 requires a - in its minimal representation. It is the first value with this property and so is the first value in our sequence."
