        "A two-dimensional permutation of n is a vector of three permutations, with the first element being the identity permutation. For example, ( (1 2 3) (1 3 2) (3 1 2) ) is a two-dimensional permutation of 3. The example is a simple two-dimensional permutation because none of the intervals of length 2 in the permutations is common among all three. On the other hand, ( (1 2 3) (1 3 2) (2 3 1) ) is not simple because the intervals covering 2 and 3 are common among all three permutations."
