        "Numbers k such that the number of groups of order k (when greater than 1) divides the group order k. I require a proper divisor > 1 because trivially for any p there is 1 group (the cyclic group) of order p, and 1 | p. Even semiprimes A100484 are a proper subset, because when k = p*q for primes p and q, then A000001(k) = 1 if gcd(p,q-1) = 1, 2 if gcd(p,q-1) = p, and (p < q)."
