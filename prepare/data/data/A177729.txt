        "A variant of A061641, which is the main entry for this sequence.",
        "The inclusion of 2 is apparently due to a non-standard definition of a Collatz sequence; A177729 assumes that the Collatz sequence ends when it reaches 1, whereas the standard definition includes the periodic 1,4,2,... from that point. The inclusion of 0 in A061641 is a bit odd, but is not actually wrong. One usually looks only at positive integers for Collatz sequences. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 14 2010"
