    "comment": [
        "Trivial permutations are identified as (1) permutation = n, or (2) when n mod 10=0, permutations of n's digits which result in shifting only trailing zeros to the most significant side of n where they drop off, such that permutation = n/10^z, where z <= the number of trailing zeros of n. So if n were 1809000, the following permutations would be excluded as trivial: 1809000, 0180900, 0018090, 0001809."
