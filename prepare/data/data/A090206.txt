        "It is possible to find a run of at least length n (not necessarily exactly n) such that n consecutive terms in this sequence are also consecutive in the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. However, it is not possible for such a run to be of exactly length n if n is even. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 23 2010",
