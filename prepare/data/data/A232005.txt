    "name": "Number of distinct resistances that can be produced from a circuit of resistors with resistances 1, 2, ..., n using only series and parallel combinations.",
    "comment": [
        "Found by exhaustive search: all configurations of resistors were enumerated, resistances calculated, sorted, and distinct values counted.",
        "This sequence allows any circuits to be combined in series or in parallel (akin A000084); A051045 requires circuits to be combined with a single resistor at a time.",
        "This sequence regards circuits as distinct only if their resistance is different; A006351 regards circuits distinct if their configuration is different, although some may have the same resistance.",
        "This sequence considers resistors with contiguous resistances 1, 2, ..., n; A005840 considers arbitrarily different resistors, while A048211 considers n equal resistances."
    ],
    "example": [
        "a(2) = 2 since given a 1-ohm and a 2-ohm resistor, a series circuit yields 3 ohms, while a parallel circuit yields 2/3 ohms, which thus yields two distinct resistances."
