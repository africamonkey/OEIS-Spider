        "The Knuth reference is from his PhD dissertation under Marshall Hall, Jr., at Caltech, Jan 01, 1963. Knuth's \"paper makes contributions to the structure theory of finite semifields, i.e., of finite nonassociative division algebras with unit. It is shown that a semifield may be conveniently represented as a 3-dimensional array of numbers and that matrix multiplications applied to each of the three dimensions correspond to the concept of isotopy. The six permutations of three coordinates yield a new way to obtain projective planes from a given plane. Several new classes of semifields are constructed; in particular one class, called the binary semifields, provides an affirmative answer to the conjecture that there exist non-Desarguesian projective planes of all orders 2[...], if n is greater than 3. With the advent of binary semifields, the gap between necessary and sufficient conditions on the possible orders of semifields has disappeared.\" - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Dec 30 2007",
