        "Numbers with exactly one prime factor of form 6k+1 with multiplicity one and no prime factor of form 3k+2 with odd multiplicity, that is a(n) is of form 3^a*p*q^2, with a>=0, p a prime of form 6k+1, and q an integer with all its prime factors of form 3k+2. There is thus no square in the sequence.",
        "From a(n) = 3^a*p*q^2, it is easily seen that sigma(a(n)) = 2 mod 6,",
        "thus this sequence is a subsequence of A074628: the two sequences are equal up to a(308) = 1723; then A074628(309)= 1729 = a(1)*a(2)*a(3),  the famous Ramanujan's taxi number, and a(309) = A074628(310) = 1731.",
        "The square of these numbers is also uniquely decomposable into the form x^2 + xy + y^2 with x and y > 0, thus this sequence is a subsequence of A232437."
