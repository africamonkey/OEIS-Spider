        "Is there any pattern in this sequence? It seems also that tau(F(m^n)) is a power of 2 for any m, any n > 0.",
        "F(2^n) = L(2)L(4)L(8)...L(2^(n-1)) where L(x) is the Lucas numbers. This greatly reduces the difficulty of factoring these numbers. To find a(9) one needs the factorization of F(512); this was done long ago: F(2^9) = 3 * 7 * 47 * 127 * 1087 * 2207 * 4481 * 34303 * 119809 * 73327699969 * 186812208641 * 4698167634523379875583 * 125960894984050328038716298487435392001; hence a(9) = 2^13 = 8192. Since L(512), L(1024) are completed factored the next few terms are also known. L(2048) has 1 known factor and a C411, thus the next term is at least 2^23. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jun 02 2005",
