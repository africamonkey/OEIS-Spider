        "The highest weight 0000000 corresponds to the 1-dimensional module on which E7 acts trivially. The smallest faithful representation of E7 is the so-called \"standard\" representation of dimension 56 (the second term in the sequence), with highest weight 0000001; it is minuscule and supports the famous invariant quartic form. The adjoint representation of dimension 133 (the third term in the sequence), has highest weight 1000000."
