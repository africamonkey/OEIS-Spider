        "The following description, due to D. R. Hofstadter, Email, Oct 23 2014, is presumably equivalent to Fraenkel's. Begin with 1, and then each new member is 2k-1, where k is the smallest unused non-member of the sequence. Thus k starts out as 2, so 2k-1 = 3, so 3 is the sequence's second member. The next value of k is 4, giving 2k-1 = 7, so 7 is the sequence's third member. Then k = 5, so 9 is the next member. Then k = 6, so 11 is the next member. Then k = 8, so 15 is the next member. Etc. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 26 2014",
