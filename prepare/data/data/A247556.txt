    "name": "Exact differential base (a B_2 sequence) constructed as follows: Start with a(0)=0. For n>=1, let S be the set of all differences a(j)-a(i) for 0 <= i < j <= n-1, and let d be the smallest positive integer not in S. If, for every i in 1..n-1, a(n-1) + d - a(i) is not in S, then a(n) = a(n-1) + d. Otherwise, let r be the smallest positive integer such that, for every i in 1..n-1, neither a(n-1) + r - a(i) nor a(n-1) + r + d - a(i) is in S; then a(n) = a(n-1) + r and a(n+1) = a(n) + d.",
    "comment": [
        "Every positive integer is uniquely represented as a difference of two distinct elements of the base set. This is a B_2 sequence.",
        "By the definition of this sequence, with d as the smallest unused difference among terms a(0)..a(n-1), we assign a(n) = a(n-1) + d, provided that this would not cause any difference to be repeated; otherwise, we assign a(n) = a(n-1) + r and a(n+1) = a(n) + d, where r is the smallest integer that allows this assignment of a(n) and a(n+1) without causing any difference to be repeated. Thus, at each step, the smallest unused difference d is either used immediately (as a(n) - a(n-1)) or delayed by one step (and used as a(n+1) - a(n)). In this way, the sequence includes every positive integer as a difference (unlike the Mian-Chowla sequence A005282, which omits differences 33, 88, 98, 99, ...; see A080200).",
        "The set is an optimization of Browkin's base, where r = a(n-1) + 1.",

        "Given a(0)=0, a(1)=1, a(2)=3, a(3)=7, the differences used are 1,2,3,4,6,7, so d=5, and we can use a(4) = a(3)+d = 7+5 = 12 because appending a(4)=12 to the sequence will result in the differences 12-0=12, 12-1=11, 12-3=9, 12-7=5, none of which had already been used.",
        "Similarly, given a(0)..a(4) = 0,1,3,7,12, the differences used are 1..7,9,11,12, so d=8, and we can use a(5) = a(4)+d = 12+8 = 20 because the resulting differences will be 20, 19, 17, 13, 8, none of which had already been used.",
        "Proceeding as above, we get a(6)=30 and a(7)=44.",

Thus, we must find the smallest r such that using both a(8) = a(7)+r and a(9) = a(8)+d will not repeat any differences. The smallest such r is 21, so a(8) = a(7)+r = 44+21 = 65 and a(9) = a(8)+d = 65+15 = 80."
