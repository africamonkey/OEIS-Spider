        "m-nomial (m>=2) coefficients are coefficients of the polynomial (1+x+...+x^(m-1))^n (n>=0), see A007318 (m=2), A027907 (m=3), A008287 (m=4), A035343 (m=5) etc. For k>=1, consider the triangle of 2^k-nomial coefficients, each entry reduced mod 2, and convert each row of the reduced triangle to a single number by interpreting the sequence of bits as binary representation of a number. This defines sequences A001317 (k=1), A177882 (k=2), A177897 (k=3), etc. The current sequence lists terms of A001317 which are not derived from any of the sequences for k >=2, not from 4-nomial, not from 8-nomial, not from 16-nomial etc.",
        "Conjecture: If for every m>=2, to consider triangle of m-nomial coefficients mod 2 converted to decimal, then the sequence lists terms of A001317 which are not in the union of other sequences for m=3 (A038184), 4 (A177882), 5, 6,..."
