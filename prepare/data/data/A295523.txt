        "Consider numbers m that are nondivisors in the cototient of n, listed in row n of A133995 and counted by A045763(n). This sequence lists numbers n for which there are more m such that m | n^e with e >= 0 than there are m that are products of at least one prime divisor p of n and one nondivisor prime q. The former species of m are \"semidivisors\" listed in row n of A272618 and counted by A243822(n), while the latter are \"semitotatives\" listed in row n of A272619 and counted by A243823(n). These two species constitute the only species of nondivisors in the cototient of n.",
        "Primes p have no nondivisors in the cototient, i.e., A045763(p) = 0, therefore A243822(p) and A243823(p) also are 0. The equality of these latter two sequences is trivial in the case of primes.",
        "Prime powers p^e except for p^e = 4 have A243823(p^e) > A243822(p^e), since A243822(p^e) = 0. All powers p^k with 0 <= k <= e divide p^e.",
        "The sequence is finite because there exist a lot more nondivisor primes q than p | n as n increases. Therefore there are more numbers m in row n of A272619 than there are in row n of A272618, since the former are products p*q and the latter are products only of p."
