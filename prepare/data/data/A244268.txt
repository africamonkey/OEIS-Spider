        "There are no numbers between 10^4 and 10^5. When n is five digits, 1n2n3n4n5n6n7n8n9 is divisible by 17.",
        "Proof: First, 10000020000030000040000050000060000070000008000009 is divisible by 17. Thus we only need to consider 0n0n0n0n0n0n0n0n0 and see if it's divisible by 17. If it is, n0n0n0n0n0n0n0n must be. If n is five digits long, let n = 00001. We see that when n = 00001, n0n0n0n0n0n0n0n is divisible by 17. Since any five-digit number is a multiple of n (and has exactly 5 digits), all five-digit numbers will share the same property.",
        "In general, for x = 0, 1, 2, ... if n is 16*x+5 digits long, then 1n2n3n4n5n6n7n8n9 is divisible by 17."
