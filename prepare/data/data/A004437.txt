        "It follows from the formula that there are infinitely many integers that cannot be partitioned into a sum of four distinct squares of nonnegative integers and infinitely many that can. Furthermore, the largest odd number that has no such partition is 103, and thereafter the terms satisfy the thirty-first order recurrence relation a(n) = 4a(n-31). - _Ant King_, Nov 02 2010"
