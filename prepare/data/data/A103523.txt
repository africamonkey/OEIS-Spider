        "Integers in this sequence can never be prime, as they are all multiples of 3. They can be semiprimes, as with the values for which the smaller prime P is prime(i) for i = 2, 12, 21, 22, 31, 36, 38, 42, 67, 70, 73, 75, 88, 93, 100, 101, 122, 131, 147, 157, ... For our example 9191019, note that 919 = Prime(157) and 1019 = Prime(186), hence since 1719191019 = 3 x 3063673 we list 157 in the indices of semiprimes, above."
