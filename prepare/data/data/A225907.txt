        "In A192824 Noe defines 0-Ramanujan primes to be simply primes, and 1-Ramanujan primes to be Ramanujan primes. Define the k-th 2-Ramanujan prime to be the smallest number R'_k (the notation in Paksoy 2012) with the property that the interval (x/2,x] contains at least k 1-Ramanujan primes, for any x >= R'_k. Continuing inductively, define n-Ramanujan primes in terms of (n-1)-Ramanujan primes.",
        "Only the first three terms 0, 2, 11 are proved (by Chebyshev, Ramanujan, and Paksoy, respectively). The rest are conjectural--see the 2nd comment in A192821.",

        "Is it true that for every n there exists K = K(n) such that for all k > K, the k-th n-Ramanujan prime is greater than half of the (k+1)-th n-Ramanujan prime? (Equivalently, is there a largest n-Ramanujan prime that is less than half of the next n-Ramanujan prime?) It is true for n = 0 by Bertrand's Postulate (see A062234), and for n = 1 by a theorem of Paksoy. Is it even true that if n is fixed, then (k-th n-Ramanujan prime) ~ ((k+1)-th n-Ramanujan prime) as k -> infinity? - _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 16 2013"
