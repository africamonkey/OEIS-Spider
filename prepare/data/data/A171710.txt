        "Consider a table T(n,k) similar to A168142 = {2,1}, {8,7,6,...,2,1}, {18,17,...,2,1},... that repeats each row. Thus T(n,k) = {2,1}, {2,1}, {8,7,6,...,2,1}, {8,7,6,...,2,1}, {18,17,...,2,1}, etc. The rows of T(n,k) decrement from 2*ceiling(n/2)^2 to 1. Then we can construct the table of atomic numbers in the Janet periodic table A138509(n) = T(n,k) + a(n), with k=2*ceiling(n/2)^2 - 1 downto 1 by step -1."
