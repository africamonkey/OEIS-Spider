        "An analog of the Fibonacci ordering of the positive rationals (cf. A226080) is the sequence of rationals produced from the initial vector [1] by appending iteratively the new rationals obtained by applying the map t-> (t+1, -1/t) to each term of the vector (cf. example).",
        "It is seen that the unit fraction 1/n appears as the last term produced in the (3n-3)th iteration, therefore the indices a(n) equal every third terms in the partial sums of A226275 (= new terms produced during the respective iteration), cf. formula."
