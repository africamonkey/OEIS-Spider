        "For n>3 there are 2 cases for the subsets: the first element '1' is included or not. If '1' is not included, then the subset consists of elements from {2, 3, 4, ..., n}. The number of subsets that include no element smaller than '3' is a(n-2); prepending the element '2' to each of those gives us another a(n-2) subsets, for a total of 2a(n-2) subsets. In the other case, '1' is included, and since 1 and 3 are consecutive odd integers, '3' is excluded, so the subset consists of elements from {1, 2, 4, 5, ..., n}. The number of subsets that include no element smaller than '5' is a(n-4), and since there are 2^2=4 subsets of {2, 4}, the number of subsets that include '1' is 4a(n-4). Hence a(n) = 2a(n-2) + 4a(n-4)."
