    "comment": [
        "A semigroup which satisfies the identity xyzyx=yxzxy is called nilpotent of class 2 in the Malcev sense. Initially this sequence looks very like A140348, which counts the words that are distinct in the free nil-2 group.",
        "The sequences first differ at n=7, where there are six equations that hold for the group but do not follow from the Malcev identity, e.g. abccaab = caabbca. Cancellation is not assumed and does not hold, so despite the fact that the former equation does not follow from the Malcev identity, aabccaab = acaabbca does follow.",
        "Shneerson has shown that this sequence grows roughly like some power of n^logn . Contrast to A140348, which has polynomial growth."
