        "Note: the property of being factorizable as C = p*q*(n*(p*q+1) + p*q), where p and q are prime, is not derived from Korselt's criterion, and is not shared by all Carmichael numbers; e.g., for the Carmichael number 340561 = 13*17*23*67, even though it is of the form 10k+1, we have (23*67) mod (13*17+1) = 209 != 221 = 13*17."
