    "comment": [
        "Terms in this sequence have at least 6 digits in base 5, i.e., are larger than 5^5, since sum(d_i 5^i) = sum(d_i) (mod 4), and 0+1+2+3+4 is divisible by 2. So the smallest ones should be of the form \"10....\" in base 5, where \"....\" is a permutation of \"1234\". By chance the identical permutation already yields a prime, i.e. a(1) = \"101234\" in base 5."
