    "name": "A positive integer n is included if n, when written in binary, is made of run-lengths (lengths of runs of 0's as well as of runs of 1's) that form a permutation of some number of consecutive positive integers starting with 1.",
    "comment": [
        "Think of binary n as a string S of 0's and 1's. By a \"run\" of 0's or 1's, it is meant either a substring all of contiguous 0's, each run bounded by 1's or the edge of S; or a substring all of contiguous 1's, each run bounded by 0's or the edge of S.",
        "This sequence contains those terms of A161001 that each contain a run of length 1."
    ],
    "example": [
        "536 in binary is 1000011000. This contains a run of one 1, followed by a run of four 0's, followed by a run of two 1's, followed finally by a run of three 0's. So the run lengths are (1,4,2,3). And since this is a permutation of (1,2,3,4), then 536 is in the sequence."
