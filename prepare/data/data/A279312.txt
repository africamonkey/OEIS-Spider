        "Let b(n) be the number of subsets of [n] that include no consecutive odd integers then b(n) satisfies the recurrence b(0)=1, b(1)=2, b(2)=4, b(3)=6; for n > 3, b(n) = 2b(n-2) + 4b(n-4). For that sequence see A279245.",
        "Let a(n) be the number of subsets of [n] that include no consecutive even integers. If n is an even integer then, a(n) = b(n). Since in the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., n} where n is even, the number of odd integers is equal to the number of even integers. For example, let S ={1, 2, 3, 4} In this set there are 2 odd and 2 even integers. So the number of subsets of S contain no consecutive odd integers is equal to  the number of subsets of S contain no consecutive even integers. In the other case if n is an odd integer then, a(n) = 2b(n-1). Since in the set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., n} where n is odd; Let K = {1, 2, 3, ..., n-1}, n-1 is an even integer so there are b(n-1) subsets containing no consecutive even integers in the set K. And prepending the last element 'n' to each of those gives us another b(n-1) subsets, for a total of 2b(n-1) subsets. Hence if n is even then, a(n) = b(n). If n is odd then, a(n) = 2b(n-1). For k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... ; a(2k+1) = 2a(2k)."
