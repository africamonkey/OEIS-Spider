        "For all k in A059242, the number m = 2^(k-1)*(2^k+5) is in this sequence. This yields further terms 2^46*(2^47+5), 2^52*(2^53+5), 2^140*(2^141+5), ... All even terms known so far and the initial 7 = 2^0*(2^1+5) are of this form. All odd terms beyond a(2) are of the form a(n) = a(k)*p*q, k < n. We have proved that there is no further term of this form with the a(k) given so far. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 23 2015",
        "A term n of this sequence multiplied by a prime p not dividing it is abundant if and only if p < sigma(n)/6 = n/3-1. For the even terms 592 and 2102272, there is such a prime near this limit (191 resp. 693571) such that n*p is a primitive weird number, cf. A002975. For a(3)=52, the largest such prime, 11, is already too small. Odd weird numbers do not exist within these limits. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 19 2016",
        "Any term x of this sequence can be combined with any term y of A087167 to satisfy the property (sigma(x)+sigma(y))/(x+y) = 2, which is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for two numbers to be amicable. - _Timothy L. Tiffin_, Sep 13 2016"
