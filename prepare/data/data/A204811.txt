        "Let [n]={1,..,n}. A number n is groupless iff there is no binary operation . on [n] such that G=([n],.) is a group, and . extends the partial graph of multiplication on [n], i.e., whenever i,j and their usual product i*j are in [n], then i.j=i*j. If n is not groupless, a witness G is sometimes called an FLP group.",
        "The term \"groupless\" was coined by Thomas Chartier."
