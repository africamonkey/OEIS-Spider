    "comment": [
        "Most sequence terms beyond n=20 are only conjectures supported by comprehensive numerical results. No proof is available for the following observations: n=30 is the first case where a square of area < n (29.74921576) is sufficient to cover n circles. The first case where more than n circles can be covered occurs for n=38. The required area to cover 39 circles is 37.76050335. n=59 is the last case where a square of area n does not suffice to cover n+1 circles (60 circles require square area 59.11626524)."
