        "Similar to A054770 \"Numbers that are not the sum of distinct Lucas numbers (A000204)\" but with Lucas 3-step numbers (A001644). Wanted: equivalent of _David W. Wilson_ conjecture (A054770) as proved by Ian Agol. Note that all positive integers can be presented as the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers in A000119 way. Catalani called Lucas 3-step numbers \"generalized Lucas numbers\" but that is quite ambiguous. These are also called Tribonacci-Lucas numbers."

    "example": [
        "In \"base Lucas 3-step numbers\" we can represent 1 as \"1\", but cannot represent 2 because there is no next Lucas 3-step number until 3 and we can't have two instances of 1 summed here. We can represent 3 as \"10\" (one 3 and no 1's), 4 as \"11\" (one 3 and one 1). Then we cannot represent 5 or 6 because there is no next Lucas 3-step number until 7 and we can't sum two 3s or six 1's. 7 becomes \"100\" (one 7, no 3s and no 1's), 8 becomes \"101\" and so forth."
