        "If (following da Silva et al.) we refer to these numbers as \"ndh-numbers\" (meaning that they cannot be expressed as the difference of two \"harmonic numbers\" [which, in this context, are 3-smooth numbers]), we could refer to the sequence of positive integers that are not in this sequence as \"dh-numbers\", and say that the set of positive integers <= 100 includes the 11 ndh-numbers listed at the link (i.e., a(1) = 41 through a(11) = 97) and 100 - 11 = 89 dh-numbers. Each of the 89 dh-numbers <= 100 can be written as the difference of two 3-smooth numbers using no 3-smooth number larger than 162 (which is required to obtain the difference 98 = 162 - 64). The table below shows results from checking every difference between two 3-smooth numbers < 10^50 (which seems very nearly certain to capture all differences in [1,10^10]):",
