        "The PARI script is good up to n=9. The last 3 terms were computed by the gcc 4.1.2 program in the link. A good approximation for the n-th term is R(10^n+10^(n-1))-R(10^n) where R(x) is Riemann's approximation of the number of prime numbers < x. This is included in the PARI script. for example, Rpr11(12) = 3612792548.5108.., accurate for the first 6 digits."
