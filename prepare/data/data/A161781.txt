        "Each constellation is encoded by means of dividing each of the increments to p in the k-tuple by two, raising two to the power of each and then summing the result. e.g.:",
        ". (p,p+2,p+6) -> p+(0,2,6) => (0,1,3) -> 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = 11",
        "Each encoding is unique and so can be reversed e.g.:",
        ". 89 = 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^6 -> (0,3,4,6) => (p,p+6,p+8,p+12)",
        "Those constellations that represent all moduli for all their matching primes p are not counted; For example, encoding #7, which implies (p,p+2,p+4) only matches the prime triple (3,5,7) which is (0,2,1) mod 3, and so is not a valid constellation, and thus 7 is not in the list. Encoding #155 is the first that fails modulo 5, and is also not in the list."
