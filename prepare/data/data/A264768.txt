        "Previous analysis of this cellular automaton have concentrated on cells that turn \"ON\". This sequence examines those cells that are never turned ON.",
        "This cellular automaton is generated by Rule 686 using the Wolfram numbering scheme.",
        "A \"SURROUNDED\" cell is one in which all neighbors have been turned ON but itself is not turned ON.",
        "See A147562 for extensive definitions, references and links for this cellular automaton.",
        "Note that the offset is zero, which implies that the initial cell is at stage n=1. This corresponds to that of A147562 where a(0)=0, a(1)=1, a(2)=5, etc. The Singmaster reference implies a(0)=1, a(1)=5, etc. The choice of offset is arbitrary and neither seems to be ideal.",

        "G(i,j) is the generation where cell (i,j) is turned ON.",
