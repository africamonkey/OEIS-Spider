        "Also twice A006128, because the total number of parts in all partitions of n equals the sum of largest parts of all partitions of n. For a proof without words see the illustration of initial terms. Note that the sum of the lengths of all horizontal segments equals the sum of largest parts of all partitions of n. On the other hand, the sum of the lengths of all vertical segments equals the total number of parts of all partition of n. Therefore the sum of lengths of all horizontal segments equals the sum of lengths of all vertical segments.",
