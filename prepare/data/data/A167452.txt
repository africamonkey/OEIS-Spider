        "Then a(2)=4 is the smallest possible choice for a(2).",
        "The next two digits (= the 3rd and 4th digit of the sequence) must be a \"2\", in view of a(1) and a(2). Thus a(3)=22 is the smallest possible choice.",
        "This means that the next digit \"2\" will occur as the 22nd digit of the sequence, so the following terms are the least possible numbers without digit \"2\": 30,31,33,...,38. These make up digits 5 to 20 of the sequence.",
