    "comment": [
        "(i) Theorem: For every initial value a(1) > 4, a minimum index n exists such that the a(n) obtained from that initial value coincides with this sequence here. Thus there exist essentially two slowest increasing sequences with this type of evil/odious congruence: A159615 and this one here.",
        "(ii) In connection with this theorem, one can generalize to slowest increasing sequences a_m(n), a_m(1)=m, which let n and a(n) be at the same time in or not in some increasing sequence c(n). (This sequence here is c = A000069, m=4.)",
        "We define a rank r of c as the minimum value a_r(1) such that for sufficiently large n (n depending on m) all sequences a_m(n), m>r, coincide with a_r(n).",
        "In particular, c(n)=A004760(n+1) has rank r=2, and A000069 has rank r=3.",
        "The problems are: 1) to find a sequence of rank r >= 4; 2) to find the rank of primes or to prove that it does not exist (in case of which it could be defined as infinity)."
