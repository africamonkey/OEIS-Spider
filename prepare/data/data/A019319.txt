        "Even though the sequence may be infinite (if none of the rules for draw is ever invoked by any of the players), the sequence becomes constant from a given rank n on, since it is increasing (I conjecture - even though some positions available at the n-th move might not be available on the (1+n)-th move) and bounded, thus it has a limit. The challenge is now to find this limit (or at least nontrivial upper bounds) and the rank from which on the sequence becomes constant. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 15 2008",
        "The sequence became finite on Jul 01 2014 with the introduction of a new draw rule which is automatic (the 75-move rule). About Hasler's second challenge, a chess problem by L. Ceriani and K. Fabel shows that at least one position is visited for the first time at ply 366. - _Fran\u00e7ois Labelle_, Apr 01 2015"
