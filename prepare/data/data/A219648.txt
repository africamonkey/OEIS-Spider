        "a(n) tells in what number we end in n steps, when we start climbing up the infinite trunk of the \"Zeckendorf beanstalk\" from its root (zero).",
        "There are many finite sequences such as 0,1,2; 0,1,2,4,5; etc. (see A219649) and as the length increases, so (necessarily) does the similarity to this infinite sequence.",
        "There can be only one infinite trunk in \"Zeckendorf beanstalk\" as all paths downwards from numbers >= A000045(i) must pass through A000045(i)-1 (i.e. A000071(i)). This provides also a well-defined method to compute the sequence, for example, via a partially reversed version A261076.",
