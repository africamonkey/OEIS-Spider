        "A \"primitive English number name\" is defined here as an English number name whose letters do not fully spell any other English number name.",
        "English number names for all numbers not in this sequence consist of letters that spell at least one of these words: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirty, forty, fifty. If \"zero\" is removed from this list, the statement is still true. Any further removals depend upon whether names such as the British \"milliard\" are permitted; e.g., \"eleven milliard\" requires \"eleven\" to stay in the list (lack of a second \"n\" does not permit \"nine\" here)."
    ],
    "example": [
        "The number 13 is not a term because \"three\" or \"ten\" can be spelled using the letters in \"thirteen\". On the other hand, 50 is a term because the letters in \"fifty\" cannot be used to form any other English number name."
