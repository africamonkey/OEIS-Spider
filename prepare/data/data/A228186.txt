        "For the interested reader in regard to materials available at the links, we have tentatively proposed a radical classification scheme for integer sequences. Based on a new paradigm for our understanding of the classification of integer sequences, we advocate this method to be functional (at least) for A228186 with it being seen to be a peculiar subset of Hybrid integer sequence made up of two near-identical integer sequences. These two sequences, using the convention employed in our classification scheme, are A100967(+0) and A100967(+1), each respectively symbolizing add 0 and add 1 to every single A100967 term.",
        "Other significant aspects of A228186, namely its highly significant connections with integer sequence A100967, combinatorics, and the mathematical fields of Chaos and Fractals, are also extensively detailed in supplied materials in the links. In those materials, we acknowledge A000001 being utilized in its role as a useful aid for our explanatory tool."

        "The inequality \"((k+n+1)!(k-n-2)!)/(k!(k-1)!) < 2 is a maximum\" provides an exact fit for the A228186 Hybrid integer sequence which consists of infinite number of 'usual' terms and finite number of 'exceptional' terms. Round (0.3807+1.43869*(n+1)+1.44276*(n+1)^2) is an exact fit for k. The 'exceptional' terms (at which a(n)=k+1) occur only when n is in {0, 11, 13, 19, 21, 28, 30, 37, 39, 45, 50, 51, 52, 55, 57, 62, 66, 70, 73, 77, 81}; the terms at all other values of n are the 'usual' terms (at which a(n)=k)."
