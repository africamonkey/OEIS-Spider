        "A tatami tiling consists of dimers (1 X 2) and monomers (1 X 1) where no four meet at a point.",
        "There are at most n * (n - 1) / 2 horizontal dimers in any tiling of an n X n square with n monomers.",
        "If there are floor(n * (n - 1) / 4) horizontal dimers, the numbers of horizontal dimers and vertical dimers differ by at most one."
