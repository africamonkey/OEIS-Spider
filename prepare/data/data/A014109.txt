        "Adding 6 to the sequence results in the first few Queneau numbers A054639.  The entries a(n) are the first few generalizations of a verse form called sextine (or sestina in Italian) excluding the original sextine which was based on the number 6. The Queneau numbers characterize all these generalizations (including the number 6). For references see A054639."
