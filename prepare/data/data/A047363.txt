        "Conjecture: Apart from 0, and the further exclusions noted below, the sequence gives the values of c/6 such that an infinite number of primes, p, result in both p^3+c and p^3-c being positive primes. Taking the complement we say: the excluded c/6 values are {1,6} mod 7. See A005097 for a conjecture on the modulo patterns of excluded c/6 values for the general case of p^q + c and p^q - c both prime, for any q>0, and see A047222 for q=2. Note that polynomial factorization also excludes a few c/6 values.  This occurs here when c is an even cube (A016743), which requires a further exclusion of certain c/6 values in this sequence when (6c)^3/6 = 0 mod 7, or c/6 = {0, 12348, 98784, ...}. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Jun 28 2016"
