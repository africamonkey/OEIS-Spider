        "An n-isohedral coloring has n transitivity classes (or \"orbits\") of faces with respect to the color-preserving symmetry group of the coloring.",
        "An n-isohedral coloring may use anywhere from 1 color (a tiling) to n colors (a \"full coloring\").",
        "Two colorings are considered identical (and hence not counted twice) if one can be obtained from the other through some permutation or reassignment of colors.",
        "In \"Tilings and Patterns\" by Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum and G. C. Shephard, 1986, pp. 102-107, the authors choose to require, in their enumeration of uniform colorings, that \"tiles in different transitivity classes... have different colors.\" However, this is more restrictive than the most general definition of a coloring, or \"colored tiling\", given on p. 102, which states that \"to each tile t of a given tiling T we assign one of a finite set of colors.\" Furthermore, some other studies of colorings actually require that some tiles in different classes share a single color (see the \"Transitive perfect colorings\" link below for an example). Hence, the enumerations in this sequence adhere solely to the most general coloring definition, with the only restriction being the prohibition of color permutations between colorings, as described in the preceding paragraph."
