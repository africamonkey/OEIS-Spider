    "comment": [
        "This sequence comes from an adaptive finite automaton. These are the numbers (entered in unary base) accepted by the machine. This automaton grows as a ring, with transitions that collect the input symbols and there are two adaptive functions: F and G. F creates a new state between the next state and the state after it, with the G function being called in the transition after the new one. The G function makes the transition a clean one and makes the following transition call the F function. These functions are activated before the transition take place (they are \"pre\" functions). The initial machine has a single state, which is the final state and a transition to itself with the F function. The automaton grows as a ring and the function calls to F and G move around the machine, making the ring grown in an (apparently) erratic and chaotic fashion."
