        "There are no terms larger than 95, which can be seen by following the chains up from 2 and 3. The only primes that go to 2 or 3 via the map x->x-ceil(x/2) are 5 and 7. The only prime that goes to 5 or 7 via that map is 11. The only prime that goes to 11 is 23, the only prime that goes to 23 is 47, and no prime number maps to 47 (since 95 is not prime). Thus the only numbers that can produce prime chains in this way are numbers x such that x-ceil(x/2) \\in {1,2,3,5,7,11,23,47}. [From _Nathaniel Johnston_, Nov 22 2010]"
