        "Isolated primes are primes that are not twin prime components. Define I(n) to be the number of isolated primes <= n. Given that Pi(n) -> infinity and I(n) -> infinity as n -> infinity, proving that pi(n) always grows by an ever so slight factor k>1 than I(n), then we will have infinity_Pi(n) - infinity_I(n) = infinity. So twin primes would be infinite in extent."
