    "comment": [
        "As I understand it, the sequence refers to \"Smallest prime p such that its following gap has bigger merit than the other primes smaller than p.\" If that is the case, then it has an error. The sequence starts: 2, 3, 7, 113, 1129, 1327, 19609, 31397, 155921, 360653, 370261, 1357201, 4652353, 2010733... but you can see that 4652353 > 2010733, so in any case it should be listed after, not before it. But above that, its merit is 10.03 < 10.20, the merit of 2010733, so it is not in a mistaken position: it shouldn't appear on the sequence. - Jose Brox, Dec 31 2005",
