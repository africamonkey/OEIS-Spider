        "This is the Lucas number equivalent of \"n occurs A000045(n) times\" (A072649), which is one of an infinite number of sequences derived from the Self-Counting Sequence [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, ... (A002024)] which consists of 1 copy of 1, 2 copies of 2, 3 copies of 3 and so on. These include Golomb's sequence, also known as Silverman's sequence (A001462) and the like. As with these others, the challenge is to give a surprisingly simple closed-form formula for a(n)."
