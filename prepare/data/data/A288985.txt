        "A287874 is the concatenation of the prime factorization (without exponents equal to 1), all written in binary (so the result has only digits 0 and 1). Here the result of this operation is considered as a decimal number. For example, the first term is 117649 because this numer is larger than the value A287874(117649) = 111110 (even when this is considered as a decimal and not binary number)."
