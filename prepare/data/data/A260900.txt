        "Numbers that are pandigital in base 2 (i.e., numbers whose digits include at least one each of 0 and 1) are 2=10_2, 4=100_2, 5=101_2, 6=110_2, 8=1000_2, etc. (i.e., all positive integers not of the form 2^j-1); exactly 2/2=1 of the first 2 positive integers and exactly 4/2=2 of the first 4 positive integers are base-2 pandigital, so 2 and 4 are in the sequence. For all k > 4, there are more base-2 pandigital numbers in 1..k than base-2 nonpandigital numbers, so there are no more terms in the n=2 row.",
        "In base 3, exactly half of the integers in 1..174 are pandigital, so 174 is in the sequence. Fewer than half of the integers in 1..k are pandigital for all k < 174, and more than half of the integers in 1..k are pandigital for all k > 174, so 174 is the only term in the n=3 row.",
