        "For n odd, one in about 7.82 of all walks have this property, while for n even it fluctuates more initially but converges to the same limit as n odd. This small constant ratio demonstrates the weakness of this test for proving with confidence better than 87.2% that an ostensibly increasing sequence is not just a purely random walk."
