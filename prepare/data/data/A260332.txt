    "comment": [
        "By diamond-shaped poset with 4 vertices, we mean a poset on four elements with e_1 < e_2, e_1 < e_3, e_2<e_4, e_3<e_4, and no order relations between e_2 and e_3. In the Hasse diagram for such a poset, we have a least element, two elements in the level above, and one element in the top level, so the diagram resembles a diamond.  The associated permutation is the permutation obtained by reading the labels of each poset by levels left to right, starting with the least element.",

    "example": [
        "For a single diamond (n=1) poset with 4 vertices, we must label the least element 1 and the greatest element 4, and the two central elements can be labeled either 2, 3 or 3, 2 respectively. Thus the associated permutations are 1234 and 1324."
