        "If w6(n) = sum a(n) q^n and w4(n) = sum 5 sigma_3(n) q^n then the Tate elliptic curve is y^2 + xy = x^3 - w4(q)x - w6(q) If |q|<1 (for either real, complex, or p-adic values) and the resulting curve is nonsingular we have an elliptic curve. The parametrization is especially useful p-adically, behaving well in characteristic 2 or 3."
