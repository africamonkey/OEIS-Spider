        "This cellular automata is formed by the concatenation of three Sierpinski triangles, starting from a central vertex. Adjacent polygons are fused. The ON cells are triangles, but we only count after fusion. The sequence gives the number of polygons at the n-th round.",
        "If instead we start from four Sierpinski triangles we get A160720."
