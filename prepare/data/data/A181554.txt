        "Topological epsilon-machines are a class of minimal, deterministic finite automata with a single recurrent component all of whose states are start and final states. These, in turn, can be represented as a class of labelled directed graphs that are strongly connected. They also represent the skeletons of finite-memory stochastic processes or sofic subshifts.",
