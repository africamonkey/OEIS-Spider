        "Explanation: odd numbers are equal to the difference between two successive squares and among even numbers, multiples of 4 are of the form (k+2)^2-k^2, thus odd numbers and multiples of 4 are not in the sequence. Conversely, a difference of 2 squares cannot equal 2 (mod 4), thus this sequence contains the integers of the form 4k+2 that are in A022544 (not the sum of two squares); among integers of form 4k+2, this sequence contains all the integers of the form 8n+6 (A017137) that are not the sum of 2 squares because they have at least one prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4) to an odd power; it also contains integers of the form 8n+2 = 2(4n+1) with 4n+1 not the sum of two squares, which is sequence A084109. - _Jean-Christophe Herv\u00e9_, Oct 24 2015"
