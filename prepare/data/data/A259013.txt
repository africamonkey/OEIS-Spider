    "comment": [
        "The diffusion rule is that if a square has more than 3 grains of sand then it loses 4 grains and each neighbor's number of grains increases by one. Initially the center square has a(n) sand grains and all other squares are empty. The final distribution of sand grains and the number a(n) do not depend on the order of the diffusion process. For this reason, it is called an \"abelian sandpile model\"."
