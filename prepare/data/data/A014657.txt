        "Since for some a < n, 2^a == 1 (mod n) (a consequence of Euler's Theorem), searching up to k=n is sufficient to determine whether an integer is in the sequence. - _Michael B. Porter_, Dec 06 2009",
        "A195470(a(n)) > 0; A195610(n) gives the smallest k such that a(n) divides 2^k + 1. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Sep 21 2011",
        "This sequence is the subset of odd integers > 1 as (2*n - 1) in A179480, such that the corresponding entry in A179480 is odd. Example: A179480(14) = 5, odd, with (2*14 - 1) = 27; and 5 is a term of this sequence. A014659 (odd and does not divide (2^k + 1) for any k > 1) represents the subset of odd terms >1 corresponding to A179480 entries that are even. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Aug 20 2012",

        "This sequence, for m>2, is those m for which, for some e, (m-1)(2^e-1)/m is a term of A253608. Moreover, e(n) is 2*A195610(n) when m is a(n). - _Donald M Davis_, Jan 12 2018"
