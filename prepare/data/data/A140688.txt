        "The usual OEIS policy is to display sequences only as far as they are known to be complete. How far is this sequence known to be complete? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 12 2008. The answer appears to be that nothing is known for certain. It may well be that 12285 is not even the first term! - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 04 2008",

However, until we have more definite information about the correctness of the first five terms (there could be additional terms less than 142310), there is no point in adding these terms to the \"DATA\" line. - _N.
