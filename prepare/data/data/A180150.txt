        "\"Quadruprimes\" or \"4-almost primes\" that keep that property when incremented by 2. This sequence is to 4 as 3 is to A180117, as A092207 is to 2, and as A001359 is to 1. That is, this sequence is the 4th row of the infinite array A[k,n] = n-th natural number m such that m and m+2 are both divisible by exactly k primes (counted with multiplicity). The first row is the lesser of twin primes. The second row is the sequence such that m and m+2 are both semiprimes."
