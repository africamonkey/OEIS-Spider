        "Proof that 38 is the highest value: 10234*38=388892 has 6 digits. Maximum value of digitsum for a 6-digit numer is 54. Direct inspection of digitsum of 10234*39=399126 through 10234*54=552637 shows that no other solution exists. For numbers 55 through 97, direct inspection shows that no other solution exists either. For n>97, the number has 7 digits, having 63 as its maximum digitsum; therefore, no solution exists for any number >97. - _Carmine Suriano_, Sep 23 2013"
