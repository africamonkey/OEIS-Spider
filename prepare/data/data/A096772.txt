        "This is the B3-sequence analog of the Mian-Chowla B2-sequence (A005282): Let a(1)=1; then use the greedy algorithm to choose the smallest a(n) > a(n-1) such that all sums a(i) + a(j) + a(k) are distinct for 1 <= i <= j <= k <= n. The reciprocal sum of the sequence for the first forty terms is 1.837412...."
