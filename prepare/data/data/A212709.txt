        "Many numbers can be ruled out from membership in this sequence with the case c = 1, which then corresponds to p + b^2 (see A064233).",
        "If a positive integer is of the form p * c^2 + b^2, then it may potentially have two different factorizations in Z[sqrt(-p)] (assuming that is not a unique factorization domain, of course): the familiar factorization in Z, and (c + b sqrt(-p))(c - b sqrt(-p)).",
