    "comment": [
        "The sequence includes an infinite family of arithmetic progressions. Such AP's can be constructed to each term, with large differences [like squares of primorials, A061742(7)]. It is necessary to solve suitable systems of linear Diophantine equations. E.g.: arithmetic progression subsequences of starting 9-chains is {mk+69147868+j} where j=0..8, m=510510^2 because square prime factors of a(4)+j=68147868+j are 4, 49, 121, 169, 4, 9, 289, 25, 4 resp. for j=0..8; k goes to infinity; 7th primorial is sufficient, 9th is not necessary. Construction is provable for arbitrary long [>9] chains. - _Labos Elemer_, Nov 25 2002",
        "More precisely, if in one run {a(n)+j, j=0..8} the maximum smallest square factor is p^2, then an infinite subsequence is given by {a(n)+(p#)^2*k, k=0..oo}, where p# = A034386(p). One may get a smaller step taking the least L^2 which has a square factor in common with each of the 9 consecutive terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 03 2016"
