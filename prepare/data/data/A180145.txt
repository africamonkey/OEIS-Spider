        "The a(n) represent the number of n-move routes of a fairy chess piece starting in a given corner square (m = 1, 3, 7 or 9) on a 3 X 3 chessboard. This fairy chess piece behaves like a rook on the eight side and corner squares but on the central square the rook goes berserk and turns into a berserker, see A180140.",
        "The sequence above corresponds to 6 A[5] vectors with decimal values between 191 and 506. These vectors lead for the side squares to A180146 and for the central square to A180147."
