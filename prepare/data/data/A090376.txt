    "comment": [
        "Some boundary mutually non-adjacent nodes of valency 2 are marked as singular; (boundary) edges incident to them are also called singular. The maps are considered up to rotations and reflections. Rooting means distinguishing a non-singular edge, an end and an internal side of it. n is the number of internal edges plus half of the number of non-singular boundary edges.",
        "No formula is known. For any generalized quadrangular dissection, s==n (mod 2), where s is the number of singular nodes."
