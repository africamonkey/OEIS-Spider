        "The number of permutations avoiding 231 and 312 in the classical sense which can be realized as labels on an increasing strict binary tree with 2n-1 nodes. A strict binary tree is a tree graph where each node has 0 or 2 children. The permutation is found by reading the labels in the order they appear in a breadth-first search. (Note that breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree left to right by levels, starting with the root.)",
