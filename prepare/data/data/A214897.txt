        "Similar to the Fibonacci recursion starting with a pair of positive integers, but each new nonprime term is divided by its least prime factor. The recursion enters a loop of length a(n) after a finite number of steps. Conjecture: the list of loops is complete (checked to [10^5, 10^5]), loops of length a(n) are unique and no infinite chains exist."
