        "\"We conclude this section by touching on the matter of singular values, k_p, which for us are defined to be the solutions in (0,1) of W_p(k'^2,k^2) = 0. These are often called singular moduli for the function lambda. ... Then, since K'(k)/K(k) is isotone, Theorem 2.3(b) shows that this is the unique solution to K'/K(k_p) = root(p) 0 < k_p < 1.",
        "\"In the notation of equation (3.2.1), k_p = lambda^*(p) and k'_p=lambda^*(1/p), so that k_p=k(e^{-pi sqrt(p)}) and l_p := k'_p=k(e^{pi/sqrt(p)}). Sophisticated number-theoretic techniques are available for computing k_p for large p, without knowledge of W_p. ... For small p one can solve directly for k_p. Thus k_1 = 1/root(2), k_2 = root(2)-1, k_3 = root(2)(root(3)-1)/4, k_4 = 3-2root(2), ...\" - Borwein and Borwein",
