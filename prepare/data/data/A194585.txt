        "\"Stapled\" intervals are defined in A090318. They are at least of length 17, and those of this minimal length are listed here. Therefore, this is not only a subsequence of A130173, but also of A130171.",
        "From _Fidel I. Schaposnik_, Aug 16 2014: (Start)",
        "Let S be the set of distinct prime factors appearing in the factorization of at least two different numbers in the range [a,b], and m the product of all the elements in S.",
        "Then it is clear that if [a,b] is a stapled interval, so is [m+a,m+b].",
        "Moreover, if a > m then the range [a-m,b-m] is also a stapled interval of the same length, so we can group the stapled intervals of a given length in \"chains\".",
        "To prove the g.f., note that S cannot contain any prime number greater or equal to b-a+1, so for stapled intervals of length 17 the maximum value of m is m = 2*3*5*7*11*13 = 30030.",
        "Then any stapled interval of length 17 must belong to a chain whose first element is at most 30030, and the only stapled intervals in this range are [2184,2200] and [27830,27846].",
        "The g.f. encompasses both these chains, namely a(2*n+1) = 2184 + 30030*n and a(2*n+2) = 27830 + 30030*n.",
