    "comment": [
        "It can be shown that, like the Fermat numbers, two of these generalized Fermat numbers are coprime if they have the same base k. However, unlike the Fermat numbers (which are conjectured to be squarefree), these generalized Fermat numbers are not necessarily squarefree for k > 1. Riesel tabulates some prime factors of generalized Fermat numbers for k <= 5.",
        "For k=1, these are the Fermat numbers A000215. See A078901 for the case m>1, which excludes the sum of consecutive squares. By Legendre's theorem (Riesel, p. 165), the prime factors of a generalized Fermat number are of the form 1 + f 2^(m+1) for some integer f."
