        "A partition p of the set N_n = {1,2,...,n}, whose elements are arranged in their natural order, is crossing if there exist four numbers 1 <= i < k < j < l <= n such that i and j are in the same block, k and l are in the same block, but i,j and k,l belong to two different blocks. Noncrossing partitions are also called \"planar rhyme schemes\". - _Peter Luschny_, Apr 28 2011",
        "Consider a set of A000217(n) balls of n colors in which, for each integer k = 1 to n, exactly one color appears in the set a total of k times. (Each ball has exactly one color and is indistinguishable from other balls of the same color.) a(n+1) equals the number of ways to choose 0 or more balls of each color while satisfying the following conditions:",
        "1. No two colors are chosen the same positive number of times.",
        "2. Among colors chosen at least once, there exists at least one pair of colors (c, d) such that color c is chosen more times than color d, but color d appears more times in the original set than color c.",
        "If the second requirement is removed, the number of acceptable ways to choose equals A000110(n+1). The number of ways that meet the first requirement, but fail to meet the second, equals A000108(n+1). See related comment for A085082. - _Matthew Vandermast_, Nov 22 2010"
