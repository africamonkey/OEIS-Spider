        "The number of different weakly connected digraphs (which may have loops) on n unlabeled nodes which have at least one node with outdegree greater than 1. A \"loop\" is an edge from a point to itself. \"Simple\" means that there cannot be two or more edges of the same direction connecting any given pair of points. A weakly connected digraph is [Weisstein]: \"A directed graph in which it is possible to reach any node starting from any other node by traversing edges in some direction (i.e., not necessarily in the direction they point). The nodes in a weakly connected digraph therefore must all have either outdegree or indegree of at least 1.\" A003085 is Number of connected [simple] digraphs with n nodes [and no loops]. Simple digraphs with loops = binary relations, so this sequence enumerates binary relations which are neither partial functions nor functions."

    "example": [
        "a(1) = 0 because there are 2 simple weakly connected digraphs (loops allowed) on 1 unlabeled node (the node with or without a loop); the naked node without a loop is partial-functional, the node with loop is functional, neither of the 2 are neither partial-functional nor functional; 2 - (1+1) = 0.",
        "a(2) = 0 because there are seven simple weakly connected digraphs (loops allowed) on 2 unlabeled nodes, of which two are loopless: O<--O which is isomorphic to O-->O; and O<-->O; the first of these is partial-functional and, if we add a loop to the unique sink node, becomes the functional graph which maps a source node to a sink node and the sink node to itself; the second of these is the 2-cycle, a functional graph which permutes two values; adding any additional loops to either of these (besides the ones described at a unique sink) makes the digraph nonfunctional (i.e. with outdegree greater than 1 at some point); hence there are 7 simple weakly connected digraphs (loops allowed) on 2 unlabeled nodes, two of which are functional and one partial functional, 7 - (2+1) = 4.",
        "a(3) = 15 because there are 20 different weakly connected digraphs (loops allowed) on 3 unlabeled nodes, including 13 different weakly connected loopless digraphs on 3 unlabeled nodes (see illustration in Weisstein); of these the following 5 are functional or partial-functional: 1-->2-->3 [partial functional and made functional with a loop added to the sink 3], 1-->2<--3 [partial functional and made functional with a loop added to the sink 2] and the 3-cycle which maps (1,2,3) to (2,3,1) [or the reverse]; 20 - 5 = 15.",
        "a(4) >= A003085(4) - A116950(4) = 199 - 61 = 138, where we still must add the number of nonisomorphic ways to add loop(s) to the weakly connected digraphs with 4 nodes."
