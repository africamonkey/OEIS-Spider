        "Conjecture: for these and only these n, the absolute value of the numerator of Bernoulli(n) is congruent 1 modulo 6.  If my conjecture is true, then you can obtain the residue modulo 6 of the abs. value of Bernoulli numerators by calculating their denominators/6 modulo 30.  Program uses the von Staudt-Clausen Theorem.  None of these n are in the complementary sequence, A233579 (n such that the denominator/6 of Bernoulli(n) is congruent to {11, 17, 23, 25 or 29} modulo 30.  I have checked and verified that, up to n = 50446, the union of A233578 and A233579 is all even numbers >= 2."
