        "These polygons fill in many of the gaps left by the Greeks, who were restricted to compass and ruler. Specifically, they make possible construction of the regular 7-sided heptagon, 9-sided nonagon, 11-gon and 13-gon. The 14-gon becomes the first to be impossible by either ruler, compass or knotting.",
