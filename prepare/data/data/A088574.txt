        "Let P = ...9..9ij...kl9...9... be a lunar prime (A087097), where the digits ij...kl are a typical string of consecutive digits that are not 9. Any number Q obtained from P by replacing ij...kl by other non-9-ish digits with the same order relationship as ij...kl is also prime. Sequence gives lexicographically earliest member of each such equivalence class.",
        "It is necessary to consider order relations of all non-9 digits, not just consecutive ones. For example, 9091 is prime, but 9491 = 91*949. - _David Wasserman_, Aug 11 2005"
