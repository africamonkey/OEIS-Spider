        "For prime p, lim_{p -> inf} a(p-1)/a(p) = 1. For example, a(10)/a(11) = 39877528/39877576 = 0.999998796..., which is so close to 1 because of the relative scarcity of numbers having exactly 11 divisors (i.e., numbers that are 10th powers of primes): at k = a(10) = 39877528, there are exactly a(10)/2 = 19938764 numbers in [1..k] that have 10 or fewer divisors, and only 3 (namely, 2^10, 3^10, and 5^10) that have exactly 11 divisors, so the number of numbers in [1..k] having 11 or fewer divisors is only slightly more than k/2, and the proportion falls to exactly 1/2 relatively quickly as k is increased beyond a(10).",
