        "There exists a unique value of c for which the sequence b(n) does not converge to 1 and at the same time always satisfies b(n-1)b(n+1)/b(n)^2 < 1 (due to rounding to the nearest integer a(n-1)a(n+1)/a(n)^2 is not always less than 1).",
        "Its value: c = 5.7581959391... A278813. If c were chosen smaller the sequence would approach 1, if it were chosen greater the sequence would at some point violate b(n-1)b(n+1)/b(n)^2 < 1 and from there on quickly escalate.",
        "The value of c is found through trial and error. Suppose one starts with c = 5, the sequence would continue b(2) = 1, b(3) = 2.23..., b(4) = 3.31..., b(5) = 3.80..., b(6) = 3.39..., b(7) = 2.48..., b(8) = 1.77... and from there one can see that such a sequence is tending to 1. One continues by trying a larger value, say c = 6, which gives rise to b(2) = 1, b(3) = 2.44, b(4) = 4.31..., b(5) = 6.92..., b(6) = 11.94..., b(7) = 35.38... and from there one can see that such a sequence is escalating too fast. Therefore, one now knows that the true value of c is between 5 and 6.",
