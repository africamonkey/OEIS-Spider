    "comment": [
        "If p is prime, then the only divisors of p are 1 and p, so sigma(p) = p + 1 and abundance(p) = abs(sigma(p) - 2*p) = abs((p+1) - 2*p) = abs(1-p) = p-1. Hence this sequence includes all values of the sequence of the primes which are one more than semiprimes. This is identical to A005385 Safe primes p: (p-1)/2 is also prime [then (p-1)/2 is called a Sophie Germain prime: see A005384] since as Zak Seidov commented, this is identical to primes p such that p-1 is a semiprime]. But the current sequence also contains composites, such as a(4) = 12, a(5) = 14, a(6) = 15 and a(7) = 21. If k = p*q is a semiprime (with p and q distinct primes) then the only divisors of k are 1, p, q and p*q, so sigma(k) = 1 + p + q + p*q and abs(abundance(k)) = abs(1 + p + q + p*q - p*q) = abs(1 + p + q) and these are in the sequence if 1 + p + q is semiprime. Note that numbers can be in the sequence which are neither prime nor semiprime, starting with a(4) = 12 and a(10) = 27."
