        "Results for p = q are given in A024702, which is complementary.",
        "All integer results when viewed in the triangle occur in loosely diagonal, interrupted \"bands\" roughly (or exactly) parallel to main diagonal, such that  q - p = 24m, where m = 1 for the first band closest to the main diagonal,  m = 2 for the second band, m = 3 for the third band, etc.  The main diagonal p = q can be considered as fitting in this pattern where m = 0.",
        "A general \"rule\" can be stated: If q-p = 24m for any m >= 0 and primes p < q, then pq-1 is divisible by 24.  This follows algebraically from the know \"rule\" that p^2 -1 is divisible by 24 for any prime p > 3 as given in A024702.",
        "No result will occur twice, even when including A024702, because the product of any two primes is unique within the set.",
        "Integer results have a density of about 12% to 13% for all possible p,q pairs among the first few hundred primes."
