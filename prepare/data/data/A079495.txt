        "In base 2 this gives the \"Evil Numbers\" (cf. A001969) and slope 2. One may conjecture that in base b the asymptotic slope will be b and might suspect asymptotic density 1/b for each result (mod b). For nonprime b larger variations occur and \"very big\" numbers must be considered to believe in the conjecture (1 million or more...). (Related to A006287, here mod b is considered)"
