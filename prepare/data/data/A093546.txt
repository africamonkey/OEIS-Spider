        "This sequence is closed under multiplication. A006521 is a subsequence of this sequence. A006521 is also closed under multiplication. In fact if m is even and k is a natural number then the sequence \"n divides m^n^k + 1\" is a subsequence of the sequence \"n divides m^n^(k+1)+ 1\" and both are closed under multiplication.",
