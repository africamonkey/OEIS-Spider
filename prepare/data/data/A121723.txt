        "This sequence arises when evaluating the generalized sub-volumes of the linearly weighted (n-1)-simplex in dimension n-1. For instance, in dimension 1 where n=2, the 1-simplex is the interval [H;J] of the real line (we suppose H < J). When H is weighted by the real h and J by j, the signed surface of the polygon {(H,0),(J,0),(J,j),(H,h)} of the Euclidean plane is S = (h+j)/2*(J-H).",
        "Then we consider I the middle of [H;J]. It is linearly weighted by i = (h+j)/2. When we search for the weights w1(2) and w2(2) so that the 2 equations 2*Sh/(J-H) = h*w1(2) + j*w2(2) = (h+i)/2 and 2*Sj/(J-H) = h*w2(2) + j*w1(2) = (i+j)/2 are verified (which implies Sh + Sj = S also), we find that w1(2) = a(2)/A098916(2) = 3/4 and w2(2) = A067318(2)/A098916(2) = 1/4.",
        "Even in higher dimensions (n > 2), there are only 2 weights: one for the considered sub-volume and the other for the other sub-volumes. For instance, in dimension 2 where n=3, the first weight w1(3) = 11/18 refers to the part of the triangle which is delimited by the 4 points: one top A, then the middle of [A;B], then the center of gravity, then the middle of [A;C]; and w2(3) = 7/36 refers to any of the 2 other parts of the triangle."
