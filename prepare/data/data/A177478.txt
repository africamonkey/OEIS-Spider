        "a(n) gives the number of permutations of [n] which avoid both the pattern 4312 and 4213 consecutively.  Also the number avoiding the pairs {2134, 3124}, {1243, 1342}, or {3421, 2431} (by symmetry).",
        "This can also be considered avoiding a partially ordered pattern:  Suppose p<s, r<s, o<p and o<r. To avoid spor means not to have four consecutive letters such that the first letter is larger than the second and the last one, the third letter is less than the second and the last one.",
