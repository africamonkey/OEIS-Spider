        "A word w is trapezoidal if it is defined over the alphabet {0,1} and if it contains, as a factor, at most one special factor of length k for each k. A factor (block) x is called \"special\" if both x0 and x1 appear in w.",
        "There are many other characterizations. For example, a word is trapezoidal if there are at most k+1 distinct factors of length k for each n."
