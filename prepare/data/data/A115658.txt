        "A subsequence of A002110. a(5) = prime(a(4))# = prime(30030)# = 350741# [= A002110(30030)], a 152104-digit number. Compare with A007097 (primeth recurrence): The current sequence is analogously the primorial(e)th recurrence but grows faster even than A014221 (Ackermann function A_3(n+1)). This suggests considering the analogs also for factorials, hyperfactorials, etc., to see which may fit as OEIS entries.",
