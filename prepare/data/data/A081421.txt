    "comment": [
        "Except for the first term, these numbers always end in 3 and 7 and necessarily generate an odd number as the quotient upon a single division by 2. Indeed for even n, 3^n+5^n can be written as (4-1)^n + (4+1)^n = 4h+1 + 4i+1 for some h,i. Then we add and get 4(h+i)+2. Divide by 2 to get 2(h+i) + 1 and odd number."
