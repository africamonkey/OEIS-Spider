    "comment": [
        "The discriminants D = a(n) which are not squarefree (not in A226693), that is a(n) = k^2*D', lead to a Pell equation for D'. For example, a(2) = 8 leads to x^2 - 2*(2*y)^2 = -4. This has only improper positive integer solutions like (x, 2*y) = (2, 2), (14, 10), (82, 58),... coming from the proper positive integer solutions of X^2 - 2*Y^2 = -1, (X, Y) = (1, 1), (7, 5), (41, 29), ...",
