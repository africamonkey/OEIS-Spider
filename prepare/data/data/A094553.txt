        "A094551 generalized to squares. Compare to A094552, which has far fewer solutions. For many values of n (5, 13, 25, 41, 61, 85,...), the value of b-a increases by 2 for each successive n. These n are the same as A001844. In other words, when n=i^2+(i+1)^2, then a=n-i-1 and b=n+i-1. The other values of n (35, 39, 51, 111, 143, 160, 856,...), A094523, have comparatively large values of b-a."
