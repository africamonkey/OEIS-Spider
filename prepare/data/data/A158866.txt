        "If the sum is a member of a twin prime pair, it always is the upper twin prime member. [Proof: Twin primes are sequentially of the form 6n-1 and 6n+1. Then adding according to the condition, we get 6n-1+6n+1+1 = 12n+1. This implies 12n+1 is an upper member since if it were a lower member, 12n+1+2 would be the upper member but 12n+3 is not prime contradicting the definition of a twin prime. Therefore 12n+1 must be an upper twin prime member as stated.]"
