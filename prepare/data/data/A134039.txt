        "The UBASIC program below was used to find A(3)=683. Suggested by Puzzle 417, Carlos Rivera's The Prime Puzzles & Problems Connection (puzzle inspired by G. L. Honaker, Jr.'s Prime Curios)"

        "Generate the sequence of Mersenne primes, reverse each and test for primality. If the reversal is an odd composite, find the first prime divisor."

    "example": [
        "a(2) = 13 because the 6th Mersenne prime is 2^17-1 = 131071. Reversed this number is 170131, which is equal to 13*13087."
