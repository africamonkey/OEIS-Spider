        "For the given c there exists a unique b(1) for which the sequence b(n) does not converge to 1 and at the same time always satisfies b(n-1)b(n+1)/b(n)^2 < 1 (due to rounding to the nearest integer a(n-1)a(n+1)/a(n)^2 is not always less than 1).",
        "In this case b(1) = 0.4970450000... A278810. If b(1) were chosen smaller the sequence would approach 1, if it were chosen greater the sequence would at some point violate b(n-1)b(n+1)/b(n)^2 < 1 and from there on quickly escalate.",
        "The value of b(1) is found through trial and error. Illustrative example for the case of c=2 (for c=4 similar): \"Suppose one starts with b(1) = 2, the sequence would continue b(2) = 4, b(3) = 4, b(4) = 2.51..., b(5) = 1.54... and from there one can see that such a sequence is tending to 1. One continues by trying a larger value, say b(1) = 3, which gives rise to b(2) = 8, b(3) = 16, b(4) = 40.31... and from there one can see that such a sequence is escalating too fast. Therefore, one now knows that the true value of b(1) is between 2 and 3.\"",
