    "comment": [
        "The 3 X 3 X 3 sliding cube puzzle is a generalization of the 2 X 2 X 2 3-D puzzle A090572. There are various designs of this 3 X 3 X 3 puzzle, but in most of them the central cube is not freely accessible and the empty space cannot be moved to the central location of the cube. The design treated in this sequence assumes full accessibility of the central location."
