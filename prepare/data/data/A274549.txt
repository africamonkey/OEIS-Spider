        "The 1-cycles (or fixed points) greater than 1 are given in A125310, the 3-cycle terms are given in A274339, the 4-cycle terms are given in A274340 and A274380, and the 10-cycle terms are given in A274338. This sequence was suggested to me by Michel Marcus when I was submitting the 3-cycle, 4-cycle, and 10-cycle sequences."
