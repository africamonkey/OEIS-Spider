        "For all but three of the terms through a(41)=274, the reciprocal of the largest prime factor of 10^a(n)-1 is a decimal fraction with a period of a(n)/2. Of the three exceptions, there are two (a(32)=231 and a(38)=264) where the period is a(n)/3, and one (a(19)=132) where the period is a(n)/4. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jun 27 2010"
