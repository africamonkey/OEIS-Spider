        "Temporary remark: I can say with certainty that the value in the Data section for a(7) (i.e., 291) is wrong. From a fairly quick pencil-and-paper check, the correct value is at least 309. (This discrepancy leads me to doubt the correctness of the value given for a(8) as well.) - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Nov 30 2014",
