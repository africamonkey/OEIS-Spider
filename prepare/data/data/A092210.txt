    "comment": [
        "The conjecture that the base 2 trajectories of the terms do not join is based on the observation that if the trajectories of two integers < 12000 join, this happens after at most 93 steps, while for any two terms listed above the trajectories do not join within 1000 steps. For pairs from 1, 16, 64, 74, 98, 107 this has even been checked for 5000 steps.",
