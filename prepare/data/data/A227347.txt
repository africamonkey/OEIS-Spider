        "Suppose that r is a rational number, k is a nonnegative integer, and let a(n) = Sum{floor(r*x^k), x = 1..n}.  By the results in Mircea Merca's article, (a(n)) is linearly recurrent.  Consequently, for integers b,c,u,v and polynomials p(x) <= q(x) with rational coefficients, the number a(n) of lattice points (x,y) in the closed (or open) region bounded by the vertical lines x = b*n + u, x = c*n + v and the graphs of y = p(x), y = q(x) gives a linearly recurrent sequence (a(n)).  Likewise for regions bounded by two polynomial graphs, etc., as in A227347, A227353, and many other sequences."
