        "This counting problem is related to the well-known problem of finding the \"chromatic number of the plane, X(R^2).\"",
        "The existence of a simple, connected, unit-distance graph that is n-colorable, 5<=n<=7, will raise the lower bound on X(R^2) from 4, the current lower bound, to n. The upper bound is 7, so should a 7-colorable, simple, connected, unit-distance graph be found, the chromatic number of the plane problem will be solved. - _Matthew McAndrews_, Feb 21 2016"
