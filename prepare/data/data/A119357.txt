        "The sequence is closed with respect to multiplication by positive integers (i.e. any multiple of any term in the sequence is in the sequence). The primitive entries of the sequence, i.e. those that are not multiples of other terms of the sequence, are given in A119425 (the first five are 6,20,28,45 and 63). The number of distinct sums of distinct divisors of n are given in A119347 and the actual sums are given in row n of the triangle A119348. Subsequence of A051774 (Max Alekseyev)"
