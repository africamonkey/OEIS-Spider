        "If a prime number's even digits are to outnumber its odd digits, it may not have two digits (as its last digit must be odd.) Neither may it begin with an odd digit if it has three or four digits. The smallest member of this sequence to begin with an odd digit is 10007."

        "64969 is a member of this sequence as it is a prime with 3 even and only two odd digits. The primes on either side of it - 64951 and 64997 - are both non-members."
