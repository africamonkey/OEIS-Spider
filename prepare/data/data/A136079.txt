        "In general, a father prime, p', of order k is of the form p'=2k+(2k+1)*p for some prime, p.  In this sequence, k=10, and so each prime is of the form p'=20+21p where p ranges over {3,7,11,13,19,23,...}. Thus a father prime p' has order k when (p'-2k)/(2k+1) is prime.",
        "Father primes (p') of order k will be of the form: p'(mod (4k+2))=4k+1, or p'=(4k+2)*j-1, j>=2. For this sequence: k=10, 4k+2=42; j={2,4,6,7,10,12,...}. So for example, j=7 generates a father prime because 42*7-1 = 293 AND (293-(2*10))/(2*10+1) = 13, since both 13 and 293 are prime.  Note that not all j such that (4k+2)*j-1 is prime will produce a father prime.  In this example, when j=11, 42*11-1=461 (prime); but 461-(2*10))/(2*10+1) = 21 (not prime). (End)"
