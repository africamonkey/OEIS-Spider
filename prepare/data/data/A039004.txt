        "We prove the McGarvey conjecture (A) a(e(n,n)-1) = 4^n-1, with e(n,m) = a034870(n,m) = binomial(2n,m), the even rows of Pascal's triangle. By the comment from Hendel in A034870, we have the function s(n,k) = #{n-digit, base-4 numbers with n-k more 1-digits than 2-digits}. As shown in A034870, (B) #s(n,k)= e(n,k) with # indicating cardinality, that is, e(n,k) = binomial(2n,k) gives the number of n-digit, base-4 numbers with n-k more 1-digits than 2-digits.",
        "We now show that (B) implies (A). By definition, s(n,n) contains the e(n,n) = binomial(2n,n) numbers with an equal number of 1-digits and 2-digits. The biggest n-digit, base-4 number is 333...3 (n copies of 3). Since 333...33 has zero 1-digits and zero 2-digits it follows that 333...333 is a member of s(n,n) and hence it is the biggest member of s(n,n). But 333...333 (n copies of 3) in base 4 has value 4^n-1. Since A039004 starts with index 0 (that is, 0 is the 0th member of A039004), it immediately follows that 4^n-1 is the (e(n,n)-1)st member of A039004, proving the McGarvey conjecture. (End)"
