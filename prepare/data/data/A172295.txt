        "A023201 is also known as the smaller numbers of pairs of sexy primes. The subsequence of prime partial sums of smaller numbers of pairs of sexy primes begins 5, 23, 53, 107, 569, 977, 1259, 1583, 3331. The subsubsequence of smaller numbers of pairs of sexy prime partial sums of smaller numbers of pairs of sexy primes begins 5, 107, 977. This is to smaller members of sexy prime pairs as A172112 is to A023200 smaller member p of cousin prime pairs (p, p+4)"
