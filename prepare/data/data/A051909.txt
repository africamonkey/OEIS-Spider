        "McCranie conjectured that the sequence is finite. He was right. Numbers 92-269 all have at least two representations without 15 appearing among the reciprocals (list attached). In the same way that Graham did for strict Egyptian numbers, we can transform each representation (a_n) into an even (2, (2a_n)) and an odd (3, 9, 30, 45, (2a_n)). Because there are no 15's in the original representations, the odd transformation has distinct unit fractions. The same is trivially true for the even transformation because there are no 1's either. So if the original sum is s, the new sums are 2s+2 and 2s+87. 2*92+2 = 186, so the even sums can be obtained from transformations after that. 2*92+87 = 271, so the same holds for odd sums from that point. And as the pairs of original representations were distinct, so are the transformed pairs.",
        "If my programming and reasoning were correct, I proved that the sequence is full (no more members after 91), and my program in the raw mode (not ignoring the 15's) corroborates exactly with McCranie's results. Could somebody prove the uniqueness?",
