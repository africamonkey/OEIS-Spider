When we multiply that polynomial by itself (in ring GF(2)[X]), we get x^10 + x^8 + x^6 + x^4 + 1, encoded by 1361 with binary representation \"10101010001\" [1361 = A048720(61,61)]. This is used as the initial value a(0) of this sequence. The next term is obtained by multiplying these two factors 61 and 61 as ordinary integers, which gives a(1) = 61*61 = 3721.",
        "3721 (\"111010001001\" in binary) in turn encodes polynomial x^11 + x^10 + x^9 + x^7 + x^3 + 1 which factorizes in ring GF(2)[X] as (x + 1)(x + 1)(x + 1)(x^8 + x^5 + x^3 + x + 1). Polynomial (x + 1) is encoded by 3 (\"11\" in binary) and (x^8 + x^5 + x^3 + x + 1) by 299 (\"100101011\" in binary). Multiplying 3*3*3*299 in ordinary way gives the next term of the sequence, a(2) = 8073."
