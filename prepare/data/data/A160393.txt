        "This sequence gives a lower bound for A090246. A003462 is the number of points in P(Z/3Z)^n. If a subset of P(Z/3Z)^n contains m points with no 3 colinear, then there are at most 2*C(m,2) points which are colinear with 2 points of the subset. Therefore if m + 2*C(m,2) = m^2 < A003462(n) we can add at least one more point to the set."
