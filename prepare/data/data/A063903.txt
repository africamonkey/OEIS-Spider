        "(1) If 2^p-1 is prime (a Mersenne prime) then 2^(p-2)*(2^p-1) is in the sequence - the proof is easy. So 2^(A000043-2)* (2^A000043-1) is a subsequence of this sequence. (2) If n is in the sequence and 3 doesn't divide n then 3*n is in the sequence. Hence If 2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime greater than 3 then 3*2^(p-2)*(2^p-1) is in the sequence. The statement (2) is an special case of \" If gcd(m,n)=1 and m & n are in the sequence then m*n is in the sequence (*) \". (*) is correct because the three functions ud, phi & sigma are multiplicative. There is no further term up to 5.6*10^8. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Mar 25 2007"
