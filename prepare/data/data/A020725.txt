        "This sequence is closed under multiplication by any integer k > 0. The primitive elements of the sequence (those not divisible by any smaller element) are the primes, A000040. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 22 2006",
        "Possible sums of the final scores of completed Chicago Bears football games. 1 point only is an impossible score in American football. But with the safety 2 and the field goal 3, we can construct the set of integers greater than 1. We can prove this by noting that if a score is even, we can build it with a series of safeties. Of course the other allowed scorings of 3, 6, and 1 after a touchdown, could also be used. Now if a score is odd it is of the form 2k+3. So for any odd number 2m+1, we subtract 3 (or 1 field goal) from it to make it even and divide by 2 to get the number of safeties we need to add back to the field goal. Symbolically, let the odd number be 2m+1; then (2m+1 - 3)/2 = m-1 safeties are needed. Add this to 3 and you will have the number. For example, say we want a score of 99. 99 = 2m+1 and m = 49. So m-1 = 48 safeties + 1 field goal = 99 points. - _Cino Hilliard_, Feb 03 2006",
        "Possible nonnegative values of (a*b-c*d) where a,b,c and d are distinct positive integers and a+b=c+d. All positive values >=2 are possible: for even values 2n take a=m+n, b=m-n+1, c=m+n+1, d=m-n, where m>n; for odd values 2n+1 take a=m+n, b=m-n, c=m+n+1, d=m-n-1, where m>n+1. Elementary algebra shows that the values 0 and 1 are not possible without violating the assumption that a,b,c and d are distinct. - _John Grint_, Sep 26 2011",
