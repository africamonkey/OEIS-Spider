        "a(3) = 5372126317 because 5372126317 is the last prime that can be generated by successively prepending nonzero digits to A101117(3). A101117(3) is 7. A101116(3) indicates that 9 digits can be successively prepended to 7 generating a new prime each time. Doing so and giving preference to the smallest digit which meets the requirement, generates the following primes: 17, 317, 6317, 26317, 126317, 2126317, 72126317, 372126317, 5372126317."
