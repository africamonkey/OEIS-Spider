        "The toothpick spiral contains n hexagonal \"ON\" cells that are connected without holes. A hexagonal cell is \"ON\" if the hexagon has 6 vertices that are covered by the toothpicks.",
        "Attempt of an explanation: in the hexagonal grid, we can pick any of the hexagons as a center, and then define a ring of 6 first neighbors (hexagons adjacent to the center), then define a ring of 12 second neighbors (hexagons adjacent to any of the first ring) and so on. The current sequence describes a self-avoiding walk which starts in a spiral around the center hexagon, which covers 5 edges. The walk then takes one step to reach the rim of the first ring and travels once around this ring until it reaches a point where self-avoidance stops it. It then takes one step to reach the rim of the second ring and walks around that one, etc. Imagine that on each edge we place a toothpick if it's on the path, and interrupt counting the total number of toothpicks each time one of the hexagons has six vertices covered. The total number of toothpicks after n-th stage define this sequence. Note that, except from the last sentence, this comment is a copy from _R. J. Mathar_'s comment in A182618 (Dec 13 2010). - _Omar E. Pol_, Sep 15 2013"
