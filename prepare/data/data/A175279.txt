    "comment": [
        "Terms in this sequence have at least 8 digits in base 7, i.e., are larger than 7^7, since sum(d_i 7^i) = sum(d_i) (mod 6), and 0+1+2+3+4+5+6 is divisible by 3. So there must be at least one repeated digit, which may not be 0 nor 6 neither odd (else the resulting number is even). The smallest terms are therefore of the form \"1022....\" in base 7, where \"....\" is a permutation of \"3456\", cf. examples."
