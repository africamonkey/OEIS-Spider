        "The recurrence given below (for n >= 1) has been derived from the following facts (i) x^2 + 4 == 0 (mod 5) has the two distinct solutions x(1) = 1 and x(2) = 5 - x(1) = 4. This guarantees the existence of a unique solution x = x1(n) of  x^2 + 4 == 0 (mod 5^n) , for n >= 2 , which satisfies also x1(n) == 1 (mod 5). See e.g., Theorem 50, p. 87 of the Nagell reference. The same is true for the solution x = x2(n) with x2(n) == 4 (mod 5^n). (ii) As a consequence of Hensel's lemma (see e.g., the Wikipedia reference under Hensel lifting) one knows that  x1(n) (which is treated here) satisfies the congruence x1(n) == x1(n-1) (mod 5^(n-1)) with x1(1) = x1 = 1. (A similar statement holds for x2(n) with input x2(1) = x(2) = 4. This is used in A269590). These two facts allow one to derive a recurrence for x1(n) (and for x2(n))."
