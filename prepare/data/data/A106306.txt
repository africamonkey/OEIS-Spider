        "Consider the 2-step recursion x(k)=x(k-1)+x(k-2) mod n. For any of the n^2 initial conditions x(1) and x(2) in Zn, the recursion has a finite period. When n is a prime in this sequence, all of the orbits, except the one containing (0,0), have the same length.",

        "A prime p is in this sequence if either (1) the polynomial x^2-x-1 mod p has no zeros for x in [0,p-1] (see A086937) or (2) the polynomial has zeros, but none is a root of unity mod p. The first few primes in the second category are 41, 61, 89 and 109. - _T. D. Noe_, May 12 2005"
