        "In Cramer's probabilistic model of primes with n urns (Cramer, 1936, A235402), there exists a distribution of maximal \"prime gaps\". We can represent this distribution as a histogram. This sequence is the distribution's median, i.e. the (unique) x-coordinate of the histogram's bar with the following properties:",
        "- the sum of this bar plus all bars to the left is 1/2 or more, AND",
        "- the sum of this bar plus all bars to the right is 1/2 or more.",
