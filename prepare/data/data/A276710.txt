        "The numbers Product_{k=0..m}binomial(m,k) form the sequence A001142(m). When m is a prime, the m-1 factors for 0<k<m are all divisible by m and therefore A001142(m) is divisible by m^(m-1). When m is a composite, this is generally not so, except for the numbers listed here (a variety of pseudoprimes).",
        "Conjecture, tested so far up to m = 3828: \"When m belongs to this list, Product_{k=0..m} binomial(m,k) is divisible also by m^m\". Since this is impossible for prime m (see, e.g., A109874), the conjecture is equivalent to the statement \"m is prime if and only if Product_{k=0..m} binomial(m,k) is divisible by m^(m-1) but not by m^m\"."
