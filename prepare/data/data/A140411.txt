        "Conjecture 1,9, p. 4, of Goswick et al. \"The squarefree numbers in question form a subset of Euler's numeri idonei [A000926], therefore at most one number can be absent from the list above. If such a number does exist, it must exceed 2 * 10^11 and if it is even the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is false.\""
