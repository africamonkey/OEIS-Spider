        "Primes p such that 10^p is divisible by p+1. Primes p whose fractions p/(p+1) are terminating decimals, i.e., primes p such that A158911(p)=0. Primes p such that the prime divisors of p+1 are also prime divisors of the numbers m obtained by the concatenation of p and p+1. For example, for p=19, m = 1920, the prime divisors of 20 are {2, 5} and the prime divisors of 1920 are {2, 3, 5}. - _Jaroslav Krizek_, Feb 25 2013",
