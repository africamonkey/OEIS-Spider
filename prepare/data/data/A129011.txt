        "Churchhouse (1971), as an early example of the use of computers in number theory, conjectured that every positive integer N is the sum of two elements of this sequence and verified the conjecture up to N = 10,000 using the Atlas 1 computer of the Atlas Computer Laboratory at Chilton, U.K. He was able to prove that every sufficiently large integer, N, can be expressed in the form N = floor(n^s) + floor(m^s), n and m being positive integers and s being any number in the interval (1, 4/3). - _Peter Bala_, Jan 13 2013"
