        "The last digit of a(n) is regarded as a glyph and the preceding digits as a number. So \"11\" reads [one \"1\"] and \"20\" [two \"0\"] - which are both false statements here: there is not one \"1\" glyph so far in the sequence when [11] is read, but two; and there are not two \"0\" glyph when [20] is read, but only one. The sequence is built with [a(n+1)-a(n)] minimal and a(n+1) always \"false so far\". This explains why the sequence doesn't begin with [10]: its statement would be true.",
        "After integer [20] the sequence matches A000027 without [100] -- because [100] would be \"true so far\".",
