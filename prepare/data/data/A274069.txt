        "The number of bitflips required to make the sequence equivalent to its reverse (to be entered as another sequence) increases on average.",
        "A plot shows that the variance in the number of bitflips increases on average, but with phases of higher and lower average variance.",
        "A plot of string length (to be entered as another sequence) shows that string length increases somewhat more than linearly.",
        "For the first 10^5 iterations, the concatenated sequence usually has more 0's than 1's (to be entered as two more sequences).",
        "A plot shows that the proportion of the sequence composed of 1's rises and falls periodically, with the number of terms between peaks approximately doubling."

        "s(1):=1. Since this is a palindrome, there are 0 bitflips; so s(2) = 0. Concatenated, we have 10, which differs from its reverse in two places; so s(3) is 2 = 10 in binary. Now 1010 differs from itself backwards, i.e., 0101, in four place; so s(4) = 4 = 100."
