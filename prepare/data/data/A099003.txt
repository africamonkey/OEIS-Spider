        "An occurrence of a ranpp (xy;z) in a matrix A=(a(i,j)) is a triple (a(i1,j1), a(i1,j2), a(i2,j1)) where i1<i2, j1<j2 and these elements are in the same relative order as those in the triple (x,y,z). In general, the number of m X n 0-1 matrices in question is given by 2^(m+n)-2^m-2^n+2.",

        "The binomial transform of [1, c, c, c,...] has the terms a(n)=1-c+c*2^(n-1) if the offset 1 is chosen. The o.g.f. of the a(n) is x{1+(c-2)x}/{(2x-1)(x-1)}. This applies to A139634 with c=10, to A139635 with c=11, to A139697 with c=12, to A139698 with c=25 and to A099003, A139700, A139701 accordingly. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 11 2008"
