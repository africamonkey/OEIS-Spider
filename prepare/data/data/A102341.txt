        "A close-to-equilateral integer triangle is defined to be a triangle with integer sides and integer area such that the largest and smallest sides differ in length by unity. The first five close-to-equilateral integer triangles have sides (5, 5, 6), (17, 17, 16), (65, 65, 66), (241, 241, 240) and (901, 901, 902).",
        "Next four terms are {three sides a<=b<=c and area}: {46816, 46817, 46817, 949077360}, {174725, 174725, 174726, 13219419708}, {652080, 652081, 652081, 184120982760}, {2433601, 2433601, 2433602, 2564481115560}. Also, if we allow degenerate triangles (area 0), the first case would be {1,1,2,0}. We have 12 cases and a weak conjecture is that the total number of the 'close-to-equilateral' triangles is finite. - _Zak Seidov_, Feb 23 2005",
        "This is an infinite series; two sides are equal in length to the hypotenuse of almost 30-60 triangles and the third side alternates between that length +/- 1. - Dan Sanders (dan(AT)ified.ca), Oct 22 2005",
        "Heron's formula: a triangle with side lengths (x,y,z) has area A = sqrt(s*(s-x)*(s-y)*(s-z)) where s = (x+y+z)/2. For this sequence we assume integer side-lengths x = y = z +/- 1. Then for A to also be an integer, x+y+z must be even, so we can assume z = 2k for some positive integer k. Now s = (x+y+z)/2 = 3k +/- 1 and A = sqrt((3*k +/- 1)*k*k*(k +/- 1)) = k*sqrt(3*k^2 +/- 4*k + 1). To determine when this is an integer, set 3*k^2 +/- 4*k + 1 = d^2. If we multiply both sides by 3, it is easier to complete the square: (3*k +/- 2)^2 - 1 = 3*d^2. Now we are looking for solutions to the Pell equation c^2 - 3*d^2 = 1 with c = 3*k +/- 2, for which there are infinitely many solutions: use the upper principal convergents of the continued fraction expansion of sqrt(3) (A001075/A001353). - _Danny Rorabaugh_, Oct 16 2015"
