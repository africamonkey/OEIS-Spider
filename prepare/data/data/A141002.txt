        "Consider a grasshopper (cf. A141000) that starts at x=0 at time 0, then makes successive hops of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., n, subject to the constraint that it must always land on a point x >= 0; sequence gives number of different ways that it can make n hops.",
        "Here, unlike A141000, there is no restriction on how large x can be (of course x <= n(n+1)/2)."

    "example": [
        "For example, for n=3 the grasshopper can hit 0=1+2-3 or 6=1+2+3; for n=4 it can hit 2=1+2+3-4, 4=1+2-3+4, or 10=1+2+3+4. For n=7 we can reach 8 in two different ways, which explains the first place where this sequence differs from A141001."
