        "Let s(k) be the sum of the digits of all the divisors of k. The sequence must, of course, include every number k such that 3 divides k but does not divide s(k). Similarly, it must include every k such that 9 divides k but does not divide s(k). The sequence also includes many numbers with relatively few divisors, since the concatenation of their digits offers relatively few opportunities to obtain a multiple of k by permuting them. Of the sequence's 2544 terms below 10000, only four exist that (1) are not primes, (2) are not semiprimes, (3) are not prime powers, (4) are not numbers k that are divisible by 3 but having s(k) not divisible by 3, and (5) are not numbers k that are divisible by 9 but having s(k) not divisible by 9: 242, 2222, 5555, and 7777."
