    "example": [
        "The highest weight 00 corresponds to the 1-dimensional module on which G2 acts trivially. The smallest faithful representation of G2 is the \"standard\" representation of dimension 7 (the second term in the sequence), with highest weight 10. (This vector space can be viewed as the trace zero elements of an octonion algebra.) The third term in the sequence, 14, is the dimension of the adjoint representation, which has highest weight 01."
