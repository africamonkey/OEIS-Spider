        "A concise description of the problem is given by Clive Tooth in the Seaman, Tooth link. Sequence terms up to n=10 were first given by Dave Seaman. Cubes having at least one vertex on the sphere and all other vertices either all inside or all outside the sphere are counted as 1/2. a(n) is asymptotic to (3/2)*pi*n^2. (Clive Tooth) The terms a(2),..,a(6) are identical with A005897(n-1) (points on surface of cube with square grid on its faces)."
