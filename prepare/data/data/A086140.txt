I add a comparison (see Links) between the frequency of prime quintuplets and an asymptotic approximation, which is unproven but likely to be true, and based on a conjecture first published by Hardy and Littlewood in 1923. Twins, triplets and quadruplets are treated as well. - _Gerhard Kirchner_, Dec 07 2016"
