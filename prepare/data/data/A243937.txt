        "Conjecture: All differences are 2, 4 or 6 such that there are no two consecutive terms 2 (..., 2, 2, ...), no two consecutive terms 4, while consecutive terms 6 occur 1, 2, 3 or 4 times; also consecutive pairs of terms 2, 4 appear 1, 2, 3 or 4 times. The conjecture is verified up to n = 2.5*10^7. - _Vladimir Shevelev_ and _Peter J. C. Moses_, Jul 11 2014",
        "Divisibility by 3 means 6m is in the sequence for all m > 0, and 6m + 4 never is, while 6m + 2 is undetermined. Divisibility by 5 means 30m + 8 is always in the sequence, and 30m + 26 never is. This proves the above conjecture. - _Jens Kruse Andersen_, Aug 19 2014",
