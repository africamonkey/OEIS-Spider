        "The active middle region of the triangle (see attached \"Wolframesque\" illustration) corresponds to the area where the growing tip(s) of the beanstalk are located. Successively larger \"turbulences\" occurring in that area appear approximately at the row numbers given by A218548 divided by two. The larger tendrils, (the finite side-trees) are, the longer there is vacillation in the direction of the growing region, which lasts until the growing tip of the infinite stem (A179016) has passed the topmost tips of the tendril. See also A218612.",
