        "As noted by W. R. Marshall, to be a term it suffices to have a digit set >= {1, 4, 5, 6, 9} as all positive squares must have one of these as their last nonzero digit, or >= {1, 2, 4, 6, 9} as squares with last nonzero digit 5 must have a 2.  This is enough to show membership for all terms < 2*10^6, and constraints from squares < 10^6 rule out the nonmembers in this range. - _D. S. McNeil_, Nov 28 2010"
