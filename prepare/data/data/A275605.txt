        "Original name was: The 'AND' Motzkin Numbers.",
        "This sequence consists of the place values from counting in a pattern where the digit is carried if the current place exceeds both the next place plus one and the place after that plus one. (Note that the place \"after\" a digit is equally described as the digit preceding it, since we write high-order digits first.)",
        "If the \"and\" logical comparison is changed to \"or\", then that modified definition produces the Motzkin numbers A001006.",
        "If the this definition looks only at the next term, this generates the Catalan numbers A000108.",
        "This is the case k = 2 of a class of sequences, counting sequences where the k-th term is not more than one more than the maximum of the previous k values. The case k = 1 is the Catalan numbers. The limit as k goes to infinity is the Bell numbers A000110. A similar series limiting terms to no more than one more than the minimum of the previous k values has again the Catalan numbers for k = 1, the Motzkin numbers for k = 2, and continues from there. In this case the limit is the all-ones sequence. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Mar 14 2017",

So we set the last digit to 0, and increment the previous one: 20. Again, 2 is too large for the two implicit zeros in front of it, so we set it to 0 and increment the preceding digit, an implicit zero; so we get 100, which presents no problems.",
