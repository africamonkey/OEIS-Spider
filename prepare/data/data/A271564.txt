    "comment": [
        "Technically, the formula is undefined modulo 2# or 3#, but their values are listed as \"0\", since there are no 6's in the first differences of their reduced residue systems. For our purposes, by \"6's\", we mean n such that n,n+6 are relatively prime to the primorial modulus, while n+1,n+2,n+3,n+4,n+5 all share a factor (or factors) with p#. The values of this sequence are tied to actual distribution of sexy primes over N (conjecture)."
