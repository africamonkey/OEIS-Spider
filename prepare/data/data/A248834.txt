    "comment": [
        "Refer to comment of A240926. Consider a circle C of radius 1/6 (in some length units) with a chord of length sqrt(8/75). This has been chosen such that the smaller sagitta has length 2/15. The input, besides the circle C is the circle C_0 with radius R_0 = 1/15, touching the chord and circle C. The following sequence of circles C_n with radii R_n, n >= 1, is obtained from the condition that C_n touches i) the circle C, ii) the chord and iii) the circle C_(n-1). The numerator of circle curvatures C_n = 1/R_n, n >= 0, are conjectured to be a(n). The denominator is A000244 for n > 0. If one considers the curvature of touching circles inscribed in the larger segment (sagitta length 1/5), the sequence would be A248833. See an illustration given in the link."
