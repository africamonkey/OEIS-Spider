        "1) The sequence is infinite, because by Dirichlet's theorem there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic sequence A*n+B (n=1,2,...) if A an B are relatively prime.",

        "3) No term of the sequence is of form 3k+2, because the sum of digits of 100*(3k+2)+13 is divisible by 3, violating the requirement of the definition.",
