        "RECORDS transform of A080189; prime p sets a new record for the number of applications of f that are required to reach 2. - a(n) = prime preceding 2*a(n-1) as long as a(n-1) is a term of A080191; if however a(n-1) is a term of A080192, then a(n) > 2*a(n-1). - Next term a(32) > 3932600000, presumably a(32) = 5274863189, a(33) = 10549726367. - The sequence coincides with A006992 (Bertrand primes: a(n) is largest prime < 2*a(n-1)) for the first 17 terms; first divergence occurs after term 39869 because this is the first term which belongs to A080192."
