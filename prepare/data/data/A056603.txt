        "Only values of A002110 arise with repetitions, but the sequence is not identical to A034386. It is more compact than A034386, but still not a repetition-free primorial sequence. E.g., the values 1,2,6,30,210,2310,30030,... occurs in A034386 1,1,2,2,4,2,4,2,4,... times, while the same values arise here 1,1,2,1,3,1,2,1,1,... times. This sequence represents a transition between A034386 and the more compact A002110."
