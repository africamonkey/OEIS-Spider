        "Garrity, p. 218, states \"Since the integers form an Abelian group, every subgroup including nZ, is normal and thus Z/nZ will form a group. It is common to represent each coset in Z/nZ by an integer between 0 and (n-1): Z/nZ = {0,1,2,...,(n-1}.\" Performing the analogous operation with the Z/3Z addition table (as a matrix), generates A007070: 1, 4, 14, 48, 164, 560... The recursion multipliers 4, 20, -32, -96 are present with changed signs in the characteristic polynomial of M: x^4 - 4x^3 - 20x^2 + 32x + 96."
