        "For a 30k+r \"wheel\", r = 11,17,29 are the only possible values that can form a a lower twin prime pair. The 30k+r wheel gives the recurrence 1, 7,11,13,17,19,23,29 31,37,41,43,47,49,53,59 .. which is frequently used in prime number sieves to skip multiples of 2,3,5. The fact that adding 2 to 30k+1,7,13,19,23 will gives us a multiple of 3 or 5, precludes these numbers from being a lower member of a twin prime pair. This leaves us with r = 11,17,29 as the only possible cases to form a lower bound of a twin prime pair. The lower bound of twin prime pairs can only end in 1,7 or 9 since adding 2 to primes ending in 3 become multiples of 5.",
