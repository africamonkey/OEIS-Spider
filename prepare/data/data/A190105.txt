        "For primes p of the form 4n+3, in the order of A002145, let us seek solutions for prime p|(a^x + b^y) or p|(a^y + b^x) subject to the conditions p = a+b = x+y and 0 < a,b,x,y < p. The larger of the two exponents x and y is inserted into the sequence.",
        "If either of (a,b) is a primitive root of p, there is a unique solution, either p|(a^x + b^y) or p|(a^y + b^x). If neither is a primitive root (see A060749), there are multiple solutions and p|(a^x + b^y) or p|(a^y + b^x) will always be one of them for some of the given exponents (x,y) contributing to the sequence."

    "example": [
        "For p=43=A002145(7), (x,y)=(11,32) because 43-(43+1)/4=32; hence x=43-32.  With (a,b)=(12,31) the unique solution is 43|(12^11 + 31^32) because 12 is a primitive root of 43. The larger of 11 and 32 is a(7)=32 in the sequence. For 43 multiple solutions occur when neither of the pairs (a,b) is a primitive root of 43: p divides each of 11^4 + 32^39, 11^18 + 32^25, 11^32 + 32^11; note that the exponents (11,32) occur in the last entry."
