        "Using coordinates (x,y,z,t) such that x+y+z+t = 0 or 1, then the four neighbors of (x,y,z,t) are found by changing one coordinate by +- 1 (such that the sum of coordinates remains 0 or 1). This sequence gives the number of self-avoiding walks of length n starting from (0,0,0,0) such that t <= z for all points and t = z for the final point. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Nov 11 2017"
