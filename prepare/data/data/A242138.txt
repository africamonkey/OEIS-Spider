        "The numbers must contain both 0's and 1's.",
        "Some of these numbers only become periodic if the leading zeros of their fundamental periods are appended to the front of their binary representations. For example, the first two terms are in this sequence, because with leading zeros they become 0101 and 001001, respectively."
