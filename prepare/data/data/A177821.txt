    "comment": [
        "By the structure theorem for compact Lie groups, every compact connected Lie group is a finite central quotient of a product of copies of the circle group U(1) and compact simple Lie groups which are all known due to Cartan's classification. This sequence counts only those which are direct products of such groups."
