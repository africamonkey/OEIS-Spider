        "This is the number of ways to cut an n x n chessboard along grid lines into two identical pieces. In the case that n is odd the central square is first removed to ensure an even number of squares. Solutions that differ only by rotation or reflection are considered equivalent. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Apr 19 2016"
