        "This sequence uses the binary expansion of n rather than the decimal expansion used in the usual Keith numbers, A007629. A number n (having a t-bit binary representation) is in this sequence if n is a term in the t-step Fibonacci-like series beginning with the t bits of n. See the example below.",
        "Let the bits of n be b(i) for i=1 to t. Then b(t+1) = sum_{i=1..t} b(i). Subsequent terms are b(t+k+1) = 2*b(t+k) - b(k) for k=1,2,3,.... (This is equivalent to, but faster than, the usual method of adding the previous t terms to find the next term.) Due to the growth rate of the numbers in the series, the term equal to n occurs on or before position 2t in the series.",
        "Terms in this sequence fall into families having the same number of 1 bits. For instance, 143, 285, 569, 1138, and 2276 all have 5 bits set. Numbers in each family are either 2x or 2x-1, where x is the previous number in the family. The binary expansion of each number in family f begins with f-1 (in binary).",
        "This sequence is infinite because for any odd prime (or base-2 pseudoprime, A001567) p=2k+1, we can create a family of numbers with 2^(2k)+1 bits set. The first number in that family is 2^c + c(2^c-2)/(4^p-1) + 1, where c=2^p-1. In binary, this number is a 1 followed by a repeating pattern of p zeros and p ones and terminated by 1, for a total of 2^p bits. For example, 2212558911 is 10000011111000001111100000111111 in binary."
