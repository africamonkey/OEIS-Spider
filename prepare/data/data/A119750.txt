        "\"You are given 5 dots arranged on a circle and told to draw segments between pairs of the points to connect all the dots. It is always possible to do this with 4 segments. However, suppose you are required to use 5 segments, that is, the dots should not all be connected until you draw your fifth segment. For instance, if the dots are numbered 1,2,3,4,5, one way to do this is to draw the following sequence of segments: 12, 34, 24, 13, 35. Another sequence would be 34, 13, 12, 24, 35; it uses the same segments but in a different order. (But careful: some other orders of these 5 segments do not count; why not?). Another sequence, using some different edges, is 23, 24, 25, 34, 15. Note that you may not draw the same segment twice. In other words, 12, 23, 23, 34, 45 uses only 4 segments, not 5.",
        "How many sequences are there which take 5 segments to connect all 5 dots?\"",
        "The sequence arises if we replace \"5\" by \"n\".",
