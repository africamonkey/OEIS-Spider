An isolated isolated divisor is an isolated divisor that is not adjacent to any other isolated divisors in the list of all positive divisors of n. A divisor, k, of n is isolated if neither (k-1) nor (k+1) divides n.",
    "example": [
        "The positive divisors of 56 are: 1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56. Of these, 1 and 2 differ by 1 and 7 and 8 differ by 1. Therefore the isolated divisors of 56 are 4,14,28,56. But 4 is not next to any isolated divisors in the list of all positive divisors of 56. (4 is next to 2 and 7, neither of which is isolated.) So 4 is an isolated isolated divisor of 56 and 56, therefore has at least one isolated isolated divisor."
