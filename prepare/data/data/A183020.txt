        "A k-sociable (or multisociable) cycle of order r consists of r distinct positive integers such that the sum of the aliquot divisors (or proper divisors) of each is equal to k times the next term in the cycle, where k (the multiplicity) is a fixed positive integer.",
        "In this sequence, a(1), a(2) and a(4) are the largest terms of 2-sociable cycles of order 3 (or bicrowds), and a(3) is the larger term of a 3-sociable cycle of order 2 (or triamicable pair).",
