        "Use 1 midpoint (resp. 2 points) on each side placed to divide each side into 2 (resp. 3) equally-sized segments or so on), do the same construction for every side of the hexagon so that each side is equally divided in the same way. Connect all such points to each other with lines that are parallel to at least 1 side of the hexagon.",
