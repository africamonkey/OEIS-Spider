        "It appears that Sum[k^j, 0<=k<=2^n-1, k in A198680] = Sum[k^j, 0<=k<=2^n-1, k in A198681] = Sum[k^j, 0<=k<=2^n-1, k in A180682], for 0<=j<=n-1, which has been verified numerically in a number of cases. This is a generalization of Prouhet's Theorem (see the reference).  To illustrate for j=3, we have  Sum[k^3, 0<=k<=2^n-1, k in A198680] = {0,0,12636,1108809,94478400,7780827681,633724260624,51425722195929,4168024588857600,...}, Sum[k^3, 0<=k<=2^n-1, k in A198681] =  {0,27,14580,1095687,94478400,7780827681,633724260624,51425722195929,4168024588857600,..., Sum[k^3, 0<=k<=2^n-1, k in A198682] = {0,216,7776,1121931,94478400,7780827681,633724260624,51425722195929,4168024588857600,...}, and it is seen that all three sums agree for n>=4=j+1."
