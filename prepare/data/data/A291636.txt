        "An alternative definition: n is in the sequence iff n is 1 or the product of two or more not necessarily distinct prime numbers whose prime indices already belong to the sequence. For example, 14 is in the sequence because 14 = prime(1) * prime(4) and 1 and 4 both already belong to the sequence."
