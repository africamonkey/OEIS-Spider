        "The subject of a recent thread on sci.math. Apparently it has been known for many years that there are infinitely many numbers that occur at least 6 times in Pascal's triangle, namely the solutions to binomial(n,m-1) = binomial{n-1,m) given by n = F_{2k}F_{2k+1}; m = F_{2k-1}F_{2k} where F_i is the i-th Fibonacci number. The first of these outside the range of the existing database entry is {104 choose 39} = {103 choose 40} = 61218182743304701891431482520. - _Christopher E. Thompson_, Mar 09 2001",
        "It may be that there are no terms that appear exactly 5 times in Pascal's triangle, in which case the title could be changed to \"Numbers that occur 6 or more times in Pascal's triangle\". - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 24 2004",
        "No other terms below 33*10^16 (_David W. Wilson_).",
        "61218182743304701891431482520 really is the next term. Weger shows this and I checked it. - _T. D. Noe_, Nov 15 2004",
        "Blokhuis et al. show that there are no other solutions less than 10^60, nor within the first 10^6 rows of Pascal's triangle other than those given by the parametric solution mentioned above. - _Christopher E. Thompson_, Jan 19 2018"
