        "There is always a prime between n^2 and n^3 for n > 1. For n = 2, primes 5 and 7 are between 4 and 8. For n > 2, we have the number of primes between n^2 and n^3 ~ n^3/log(n^3) - n^2/log(n^2) = n^2(2n-3)/(6log(n)) -> infinity as n -> infinity. A corollary to this is the number of primes are infinite.",
