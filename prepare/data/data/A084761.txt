        "The sequence of successive difference ratios {a(m)-a(m-1)}/{a(m-1)-a(m-2)} is 2,1,3,4,5,6,8,7,... Conjecture:(1) every number is a term of this sequence, or for every number r there exists some k such that {a(k) - a(k-1)}/{a(k-1)-a(k-2)}= r. Question: What is the longest string of consecutive integers in this sequence ( of successive differences)?"
