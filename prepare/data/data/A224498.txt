    "comment": [
        "A similar sequence is A100559. There the minimum prime is considered without any constraints on the set of squares. In fact for n=14 the smallest prime is 1171 that corresponds to the sum of the squares of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, where the greatest number is 16. Instead in A224498 the minimum prime is 1231 coming from the sum of the squares of  1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, where the maximum number is 15 < 16.",
