        "I would also like to tabulate the corresponding sequences for 3rd and higher powers of f(x) in separate sequences, maybe as far as 12th powers of f, assigning new numbers to each such sequence. For example, for the 3rd power, the sequence would begin {9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 31, etc. (the first \"gap\" appearing at 29). Each sequence would show no more than perhaps 500 (?) terms, or whatever number is needed to display a first gap.",
