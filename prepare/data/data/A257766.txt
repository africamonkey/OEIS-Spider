        "Sequence is finite since it cannot contain numbers of 9 or more digits. Indeed a number of 9 digits is at least equal to 10^8, but the function computed here for a number of n digits is at most (9*n)*(9^2*n)^2, which for n=9 is 43046721 < 10^8. - _Giovanni Resta_, May 08 2015"

    "example": [
        "52215 is in the sequence because 52215 = (5+2+2+1+5)*(5^2+2^2+2^2+1^2+5^2)^2."
