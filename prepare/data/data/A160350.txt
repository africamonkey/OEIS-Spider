        "A polynomial is called flat iff it is of height 1, where the height is the largest absolute value of the coefficients.",
        "A cyclotomic polynomial phi(n) is said of order 3 iff n=pqr with distinct (usually odd) primes p,q,r.",
        "It is well known that phi(n) is flat if n has less than 3 odd prime factors, so this sequence includes all numbers of the form 2pq, with primes q>p>2, i.e. A075819. Sequence A117223 lists the complement, i.e. odd terms in this sequence, which start with 231 = 3*7*11.",
        "Moreover, Kaplan shows that the present sequence also includes pqr if r = +-1 (mod pq). Sequence A160352 lists the subsequence of all such numbers, while A160354 lists elements which are not of this form."
