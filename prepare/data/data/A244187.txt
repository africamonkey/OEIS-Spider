        "Trivially, (10*m)^k can end in any number of zeros. Thus numbers divisible by 10 are not included in this sequence.",
        "This sequence contains only numbers that end in a 1, 3, or 7.",
        "Those that end in 1 are congruent to {71, 231, 311, 391} mod 400.",
        "Those that end in 3 are congruent to {53, 133, 213, 373} mod 400 or are a subsequence of 273 mod 320 (for n < 2000, only 593 == 273 mod 320 but it is not a member of this sequence).",
        "Those that end in 7 are congruent to {77, 237, 317, 397} mod 400 or are a subsequence of 177 mod 320 (for n < 2000, only 1457 == 177 mod 320 but it is not a member of this sequence).",
        "If a(n) ends in a 1, then a(n+1) ends in a 7 and a(n+1) = a(n)+6. Note that the converse is not true.",
        "Fix an M large enough. There exists infinitely many k such that a(n)^k ends in M of the same digit. Those k values can be given as X mod Y for some X and Y. Take two consecutive powers k and k' that satisfy this. Let the digit immediately before the repeating digit in a(n)^k be called D and the digit immediately before the repeating digit in a(n)^k' be called D'. D - D' will always be odd for large enough M. Example: M = 4 and a(n) = 71. 71^k ends in 4 ones for k = 13, 263, 513, 763, ... == 13 mod 250. Taking k = 13 and k' = 263, 71^13 ends in 31111 and 71^263 ends in 61111. Thus, D = 3 and D' = 6, and we see 3 - 6 is odd."

This can continue for any number of 3's, where the exponent of 53 is some function based on how many 3's are at the end. We see f(2) = 9, f(3) = 29, f(4) = 529, f(5) = 4529, f(6) = 49529, and so on.
