    "comment": [
        "Let Z be the sum of 25 consecutive primes. The necessary condition to get a magic square of these primes is: z = 5(2m + 1), where m is natural number. The magic constant of expected square is S = 2m + 1.",
        "The first array of consecutive primes, which satisfies this condition, can be obtained for m = 156. This array gives the smallest magic square with magic constant 313.",
        "But not every array of 25 consecutive primes, satisfying the above condition, can be arranged into a magic square. Of the first 50 potential arrays we get 32 magic squares.",
        "The suitable and non-suitable arrays are forming a certain pattern. There is an assumption that the sequence can be continued indefinitely.",
        "Another problem is to find all the magic squares from the certain array. There is an implemented algorithm to solve it, but it takes quite much time.",
        "Let K be the total number of magic squares composed of the numbers of the array for the rotations and reflections.",
        "It was possible to obtain: for S = 949 K = 16140, for S = 1703 K = 5608."
