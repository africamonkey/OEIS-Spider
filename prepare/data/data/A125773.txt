        "A068535(n) includes all powers of 2. a(3) = 1093 and a(7) = 3511 are the only known primes in a(n). They belong to A001220(n) = Wieferich primes p: p^2 divides 2^(p-1) - 1. Note that most listed terms of a(n) are the multiples of Wieferich primes 1093 and 3511. No more terms in a(n) up to 6*10^6."
