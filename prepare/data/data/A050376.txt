        "Every number n is a product of a unique subset of these numbers: in the prime factorization n = prod( j>=1, p(j)^e(j) ) expand every exponent e(j) as binary number and pick the terms of this sequence corresponding to the positions of the ones in binary (it is clear that both n and n^2 have the same number of factors in this sequence, and that each factor appears with exponent 1 or 0).",
        "Or, a(1) = 2; for n>1, a(n) = smallest number which cannot be obtained as the product of previous terms. This is evident from the unique factorization theorem and the fact that every number can be expressed as the sum of powers of 2. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Jan 09 2002",
        "Except for the first term, same as A084400. - _David Wasserman_, Dec 22 2004",
        "The least number having 2^n divisors (=A037992(n)) is the product of the first n terms of this sequence according to Ramanujan.",
        "According to the Bose-Einstein distribution of particles, an unlimited number of particles may occupy the same state. On the other hand, according to the Fermi-Dirac distribution, no two particles can occupy the same state (by the Pauli exclusion principle). Unique factorizations of the positive integers by primes (A000040) and over terms of A050376 one can compare with two these distributions in physics of particles. In the correspondence with this, the factorizations over primes one can call \"Bose-Einstein factorizations\", while the factorizations over distinct terms of A050376 one can call \"Fermi-Dirac factorizations\". - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 16 2010",
        "The numbers of the form p^(2^k), where p is prime and k >= 0, might thus be called the \"Fermi-Dirac primes\", while the classic primes might be called the \"Bose-Einstein primes\". - _Daniel Forgues_, Feb 11 2011",
        "In the theory of infinitary divisors, the most natural name of the terms is \"infinitary primes\" or \"i-primes\". Indeed, n is in the sequence, if and only if it has only two infinitary divisors. Since 1 and n are always infinitary divisors of n>1, an i-prime has no other infinitary divisors. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Feb 28 2011",
        "{a(n)} is the minimal set including all primes and closed with respect to squaring. In connection with this, note that n and n^2 have the same number of factors in their Fermi-Dirac representations. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Mar 16 2012",
        "In connection with this sequence, call an integer compact if the factors in its Fermi-Dirac factorization are pairwise coprime. The density of such integers equals (6/pi^2)*prod{prime p}(1+(sum{i>=1} p^(-(2^i-1))/(p+1))=0.872497... It is interesting that there exist only 7 compact factorials listed in A169661. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Mar 17 2012",
