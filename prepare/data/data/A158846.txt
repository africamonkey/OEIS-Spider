        "We iteratively scan integer intervals (2^(m-1)..2^m), first the one with m=5, then m=6, m=7 etc., and start with the set S={3,5,7,11..} of all odd primes. For each prime p=2^m-k, 2^(m-1) <p < 2^m, p is removed from S if k is in S. Basically, all the upper primes of primes pairs are removed when the prime pair sums to a power of 2 which are larger than 2^4. The sequence shows all p that are removed from S at any stage m.",
