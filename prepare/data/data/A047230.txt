        "If a(n) = the n-th Towers of Hanoi move, the smallest disc (#1) is on peg B. (Cf. A047264, A047239). For TOH moves 1 and 2, disc #1 is on peg C. For moves 3 and 4, it's on peg B, and for moves 5 and 6, it's on peg A. The cycle continues CBACBACBA... for moves (7,8), (9,10), (11,12), etc. So disc #1 is on peg B for TOH moves (3, 4, 9, 10, 15, 16, ...). - _Gary W. Adamson_ Jun 22 2012"
