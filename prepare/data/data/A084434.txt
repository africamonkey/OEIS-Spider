        "Initially (up to two-digit numbers) members match with those of A071249. The fFollowing are members of this sequence. (1) Numbers made of even digits (GCD >= 2). (2) Numbers with sum of digits a multiple of 3 (GCD >= 3). (3) Numbers using only one digit (k*repunit, k = 1 to 9, GCD = the number itself). It is conjectured that there are no other members.",
