        "\"Sporadic\" solutions s: these are the solutions that remain from  A269563, when we remove the four known infinite families of solutions in polynomial progression (see the comments in A269563) and also remove all the nine known infinite families of solutions in exponential progression (see the comments in A269499). These nine families are the s = 2*m + p, where p=4,5,6 or 8 and (m,t) are positive integer solutions to some diophantine bivariate polynomial equation of degree 2:",
