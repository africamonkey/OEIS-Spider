        "By re-writing the sequence of sums as 1-Product[1-1/Prime[n]], one can show that the product goes to zero and the sequence of sums converges to 1. This is interesting because the terms approach 1/(2*Prime[n]) for large n, and a sum of such terms might be expected to diverge, since Sum{1/(2*Prime[n]} diverges."
