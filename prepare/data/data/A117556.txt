        "We may define the n-limit Pepper ambiguity, for any odd number n greater than one, as the maximum of the ratios of the errors of the nearest approximation to the members of the n-limit tonality diamond to the next nearest. In the 9-limit, that means we look at the ratios of the errors for the nearest approximations to 3/2, 5/4, 5/3, 7/4, 7/5, 7/6, 9/8, 9/7 and 9/5 to the next nearest."
