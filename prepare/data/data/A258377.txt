        "For a fixed integer N, Hanna has considered the problem of finding an o.g.f. of the form A(z) = 1 + N*z + a(2)*z^2 + a(3)*z^3 + ..., with integer coefficients a(2), a(3), ... dependent on the parameter N, which is a solution to the functional equation A^(N+1) = ( BINOMIAL(A) )^N. Here BINOMIAL(F(z))= 1/(1 - z)*F(z/(1 - z)) denotes the binomial transform of the o.g.f. F(z).",
        "The function A(z) is related to the triangle of ordered Stirling numbers A019538 via logarithmic differentiation. It can be shown that z*A'(z)/A(z) = Sum_{k >= 1} R(k,N)*z^k, where R(k,x) denotes the k-th row polynomial of A019538; equivalently, A(z) = exp( Sum_{k >= 1} R(k,N)*z^k/k ).",
        "Cases include A084784 (N = 1), A090352 (N = 2), A090355 (N = 3), A090357 (N = 4), A090362 (N = 5) and a signed version of A084785 (N = -2).",
        "It turns out that the o.g.f. B(z) := A(z)^(1/N) also has integer coefficients. It satisfies the functional equation B^(N+1) = BINOMIAL(B^N). For cases see A084784 (N = 1), A090351 (N = 2), A090353 (N = 3), A090356 (N = 4), A090358 (N = 5) and A084784 (N = -2).",

This is the type B analog of Hanna's type A functional equation above.",
        "It can be shown that z*A'(z)/A(z) = Sum_{k >= 1} P(k,N)*z^k, where P(k,x) denotes the k-th row polynomial of A145901. However, unlike the type A situation, the type B function A(z)^(1/N) does not have all integer coefficients.",
        "The present sequence is the case N = 1. For further examples of solutions to the type B functional equation see A258378 (N = 2), A258379 (N = 3), A258380 (N = 4) and A258381 (N = 5).",

For example, a(n) (mod 4) = (1,3,1,3,...) seems to be purely periodic with period 2 and a(n) (mod 8) = (1,3,5,7,1,3,5,7,...) seems to be purely periodic with period 4 (both checked up to n = 1000).",
