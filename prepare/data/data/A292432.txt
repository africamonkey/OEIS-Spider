        "A multiset is normal if it spans an initial interval of positive integers. Most normal multisets can be expressed as the multiset-union of a set of sets. For example, {1,1,2,2} is the multiset-union of {{1},{2},{1,2}}."

        "The a(6) = 9 multisets are: {1,1,1,1,1,1}, {1,1,1,1,1,2}, {1,1,1,1,2,2}, {1,1,1,1,2,3}, {1,1,1,2,2,2}, {1,1,2,2,2,2}, {1,2,2,2,2,2}, {1,2,2,2,2,3}, {1,2,3,3,3,3}."
