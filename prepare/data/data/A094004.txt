        "Start with an initial string of n numbers s(1), ..., s(n), all = 2 or 3. The rule for extending the string is this:",
        "To get s(i+1), write the string s(1)s(2)...s(i) as xy^k for words x and y (where y has positive length) and k is maximized, i.e. k = the maximal number of repeating blocks at the end of the sequence so far (k is the \"curling number\" of the string). Then set s(i+1) = k if k >=2, but if k=1 you must stop (without writing down the 1).",
        "The \"Curling Number Conjecture\" is that if one starts with any finite string and repeatedly extends it by appending the curling number k, then eventually one must reach a 1. This has not yet been proved.",
        "The values shown for n >= 49 are only conjectures, because certain assumptions used to cut down the search have not yet been rigorously justified. However, we believe that ALL terms shown are correct. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 17 2012"
