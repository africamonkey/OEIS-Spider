        "These matrices are notorious for being ill-conditioned, they are solved using rational arithmetic. To reproduce these numbers, or larger ones, one can edit the program above with a text editor and then drag it into the Maxima window. The last term required approx. 10 minutes to generate on an Intel dual-core 6600 clocked at 2.4 GHz with 2 Gig of RAM. To change the order of the Hilbert matrix, just change the order variable at the top of the file. It is currently 4, which runs quickly. So a point of curiosity really. The numbers become extremely expensive to find, growing at least as the cube of n times a large constant. So to me they are a kind of symbolic gold. The 100th number for example, is probably not knowable at the current time, but that is speculation on my part. Perhaps you will observe some functional relationship that allows their simple generation thus \"Cracking the Hilbert-Warren Sequence Code\". For example 12 = 4 * 4 - 4, 20 = 5 * 5 - 5, 300 = 20 * 20 - 100, 525 = 25 * 25 - 100 and so on."
