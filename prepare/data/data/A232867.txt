        "Let S be the sequence (or tree) of complex numbers defined by these rules:  0 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1, and i*x are in S.  Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations of S are given by g(1) = (0), g(2) = (1), g(3) = (2,i), g(4) = (3, 2i, 1+i, -1), ... Concatenating these gives 0, 1, 2, i, 3, 2*i, 1 + i, -1, 4, 3*i, 1 + 2*i, -2, 2 + i, -1 + i, -i, 5, ...  It appears that if c and d are integers, than the positions of c*n+d*i, for n>=0, comprise a linear recurrence sequence with signature beginning with 3, -3, 1, following for zero or more 0's."
