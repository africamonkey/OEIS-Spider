    "comment": [
        "The polynomials are of the form (x-prime(i))*(x-prime(i+1))*..*(x-prime(i+4)). The quadratic terms have coefficients which are of the form -sum_{j<k<l} prime(j)*prime(k)*prime(l), summing over all 10 =C(5,3) combinations of products of three distinct primes in the range prime(i) to prime(i+4). If half of the absolute (sign-reversed) coefficient is prime, it is added to the sequence."
