    "comment": [
        "The edge a(n) is partitioned into q=s^2 - t^2=A088243(n)*A088296(n) and r=t(2s+t)=A088242(n)*A088299(n) by a cevian of length p. [Alternatively, (p,q,r) form a triangle with angle 2pi/3 opposite side p.] The quadruple {p,q,r,a(n)=q+r} satisfies the triangle relation: see A061281, or the simpler relation a(n)^2 = p^2 + q*r."
