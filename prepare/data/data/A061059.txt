        "Yes: primorial(n) = A002110(n) = Pn# is never a square, it has N=2^n distinct divisors. This is an even number, and the N divisors can be grouped in pairs d(k), d(N+1-k) with product equal to Pn#, and one being smaller and one being larger than sqrt(Pn#). This sequence gives the (2^(n-1)+1)-th divisor, which is the smallest one larger than sqrt(Pn#). - M. F. Hasler, Sep 20 2011"
