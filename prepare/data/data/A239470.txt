        "Suppose that p is a partition of n into 2 or more parts and that h is a part of p.  Then p is (h,0)-separable if there is an ordering x, h, x, h, ..., h, x of the parts of p, where each x represents any part of p except h.  Here, the number of h's on the ends of the ordering is 0.  Similarly, p is (h,1)-separable if there is an ordering x, h, x, h, ... , x, h, where the number of h's on the ends is 1; next, p is (h,2)-separable if there is an ordering h, x, h, ... , x, h.  Finally, p is h-separable if it is (h,i)-separable for i = 0,1,2."
