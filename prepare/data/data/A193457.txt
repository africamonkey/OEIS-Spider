        "This sequence is the solution to the following problem: \"Suppose you have the choice of using one of three production options: apply a simple action, bundle all existing actions (which requires p=5 steps), or apply the current bundled action. The first use of a novel bundle erases (or makes obsolete) all prior actions.  How many total actions (simple) can be applied in n time steps?\"",
        "1. This problem is structurally similar to the Copy and Paste Keyboard problem: Existing sequences (A178715 and A193286) should be regarded as Paradigm-Shift Sequences with Procedural Lengths p=1 and 2, respectively.",
        "2. The optimal number of pastes per copy, as measured by the geometric growth rate (p+z root of z), is z = 6. [Non-integer maximum between 6 and 7.]",
        "3. The function a(n) = maximum value of the product of the terms k_i, where Sum (k_i) = n+ 5 - 5*i_max",
