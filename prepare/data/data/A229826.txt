        "By the Moser-Newman phenomenon, among the first N positive integers divisible by 3, the evil numbers are always in the majority. But what happens if we remove from the positive numbers the multiples of 3? We conjecture that in this case we obtain another phenomenon: among the first N such positive integers divisible by 7, the odious numbers (A000069) are always in the majority."
