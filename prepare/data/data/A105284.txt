    "comment": [
        "Removing all such intervals (without an upper limit on n) leaves a nowhere dense subset of [0,1]. However, since each step removes additional points of measure no more than 1/2^(n+1), this nowhere dense subset must make up at least half of [0,1] and so be of positive measure. In fact its measure is 0.535573680435778224753342807..., the limit of a(n)/A000302(n)."

The second step in addition removes the intervals [7/32,9/32] and [23/32,25/32], leaving a subset with a measure of 5/8=10/16. The third step in addition removes the intervals [15/128,17/128], [47/128,3/8), (5/8,81/128] and [111/128,113/128], leaving a subset with a measure of 37/64."
