        "This sequence is wrong because of a bug in Mr Parkin's code, and amazingly I can pinpoint exactly what the bug is! ( I can reproduce his results).",
        "Firstly the description of the problem and its solution in Mr Parkin's letter is very clear - he doesn't leave a lot of room for misinterpretation (this is hugely to his credit). He also includes a very clear description of his algorithm, so I decided I would just code it up. I obtained Giovanni Resta's results as given in A257952 - there is nothing wrong with Mr Parkin's algorithm.",
        "A detailed break-down of Parkin's results is also provided in the letter. All the results match with the exception of the final line. (this would be highly improbable if there was a completely different interpretation). In any case, one sentence stood out as a possible red flag:  \"Further, there are potential mirror image paths in both cases  when starting on the centre lines and these are prevented by requiring a turn in one direction on the path prior to allowing a turn in the other direction\" (bottom of page 6).  The discrepancy in results does indeed relate to the centre line and if I modify my code to lose the flag on recursion, then I get Mr Parkin's results (so turn in one direction is only prohibited for one step).
