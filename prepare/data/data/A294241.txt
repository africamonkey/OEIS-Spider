        "We must have a(2n) >= a(n) because one can always place onto a 2n X 2n toroidal board four identical copies of a record-setting pattern for a(n), so that each copy of the pattern \"thinks\" that it is the sole occupant of an n X n toroidal board and thus acts accordingly. See also comments in A179412 for a related question about the longest repeating pattern on a toroidal board. - _Antti Karttunen_, Oct 30 2017"
