        "This also counts a restricted set of plane partitions of n. Each element of the set which contains the A000041(n) partitions of n can be converted into plane partitions by insertion of line feeds at some or all places of the \"pluses.\" Since the length of rows in plane partitions must be nonincreasing, there are only A000041(L(P)) ways to comply with this rule, where L(P) is the number of terms in that particular partition. Example for n=4: consider all five partitions 4 = 3+1 = 2+2 = 2+1+1 = 1+1+1+1 of four. The associated a(4)=13 plane partitions are 4, 31, 3|1, 22, 2|2, 211, 21|1, 2|1|1, 1111, 111|1, 11|11, 11|1|1 and 1|1|1|1, where the bar represents start of the next row, where a(4) = A000041(L(4)) + A000041(L(3+1)) + A000041(L(2+2)) + A000041(L(2+1+1))+ A000041(L(1+1+1+1)) = A000041(1) + A000041(2) + A000041(2) + A000041(3) + A000041(4). By construction from sorted partitions, all the plane partitions are strictly decreasing along each row and each column. - _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 12 2008"
