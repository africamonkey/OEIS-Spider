        "Note that from 2!+3!+5!+7! on, the power of 2 will always be 2^4. So after the first 3 terms, an equivalent definition is that the sum has the form 16p for some prime p. Also, the sequence is finite: For all n>=762, prime(1)! + ... + prime(n)! is divisible by prime(763) = 5813 and is therefore not of the form 16p. - _Dean Hickerson_."
