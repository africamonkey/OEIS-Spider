        "The prime 479 first appears in 2395, ahead of 71, which first appears at 2485. The first occurrence of four distinct primes is at 2500, with 5^7 17^3, 17 and 479. For 1890<n<2006, d(n) is square (f(n)=1). The lone prime in 1875-1890 is 61 and in 2006-2027 it is 59. It appears that adjacent years can differ in at most one prime.",
