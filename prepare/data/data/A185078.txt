        "Note that, if there exist infinitely many infinitary perfect numbers (A007357), then, for n tends to infty over such numbers, A064380(n)/n=1/2+o(n^(-1+eps)). We conjecture that here A064380(n)/n infinitely many times equals to 1/2, and thus the sequence contains infinitely many infinitary perfect numbers."
