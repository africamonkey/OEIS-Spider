        "If m>0 and p=4*3^m-1 is prime(m is in the sequence A005540) then n=3^m*p is in the sequence. Because sigma(n)-n=(1/2)*(3^(m+1)-1) *4*3^m-3^m*(4*3^m-1)=3^m*(2*3^m-1)=(3/4)*(2*3^(m-1))*((4*3^m-1)-1) =(3/4)*phi(3^m)*phi(p)=(3/4)*phi(3^m*p)=(3/4)*phi(n). The first four terms of the sequence are of such form if the 5th term is also of such form then it is equal to 823564514029689. Next term is greater than 2*10^9. Is it true that all terms are of the mentioned form?",
