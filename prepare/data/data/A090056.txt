    "comment": [
        "Trivial permutations are identified as those where the permutation = n itself. Digit loss occurs when a permutation has 0 in the most significant position, which drops off, leaving a number with fewer digits. For example, when n is 3105, the permutation 0315 is excluded because 315 has fewer digits than 3105. These exclusions make this sequence a subset of A090055. A084687 is a subset of this sequence.",
        "Apparently each term of this sequence is divisible by 3. This has been confirmed for the first 100 terms."
