    "comment": [
        "This sequence arises in the analytically obtained strict upper bound of the set of equivalent resistances formed by any conceivable network (series/parallel or bridge, or non-planar) of n equal resistors. Consequently it provides a strict upper bound of the sequences: A048211, A153588, A174283, A174284, A174285 and A174286. A better strict bound is obtained by the Sequence A176501, but it is difficult to compute due to memory limitations.",
