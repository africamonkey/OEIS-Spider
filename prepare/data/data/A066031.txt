        "Primes and powers of primes have been excluded from the sequence because they trivially satisfy the condition \"the sum of the prime factors of n divides n\". Call a term of the sequence \"primitive\" if it is not a multiple of some previous term; for example, 70 is primitive while 60 is not. Are there infinitely many primitive terms? See A064623.",
