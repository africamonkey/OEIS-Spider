    "comment": [
        "In general, the simple continued fraction expansion of sqrt(m) is a periodic palindromic sequence. That is, contfrac( sqrt(m) ) = [c(0); c(1), c(2), ..., c(p), c(p+1), ...] where p is the period. c(p) = 2*c(0), c(k) = c(p+k) for k>0, c(k) = c(p-k) for p>k>0. If the period p is odd, then p = 2*k+1 and c(k) = c(k+1) can be considered a pair of equal central terms. If the period is even, then p = 2*k and the unique central term is c(k). - _Michael Somos_, Apr 04 2014"
