    "comment": [
        "The term corresponding to divisibility by 3^14 and ^15 is similar to the corresponding number for divisibility by 7^7 (through 7^11), 3838989, and it also arises through the addition of 3433969 to the number of digits in all primes under 1000000.  Also, the 9th (and 8th) term (corresponding to the value 50333 in A183194) is derived by adding 3^9+2 (5*3937) to the number of digits in all primes under 10000.   Nice coincidences for this 400th anniversary of the death of Ludolph van Ceulen."
