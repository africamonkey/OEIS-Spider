        "The numbers whose binary representation is a palindrome are excluded by definition because 0 is not a power of a positive number.",
        "It might be thought that the first term should be 1 instead of 2, since by prepending its binary representation (itself) with a zero we get 01 with reverse 10 (decimal 2), and their difference in absolute value is abs(1-2)=1, which is itself its 1st power 1^1. However, leading zeros are ignored. Another alternative interpretation is to consider 1 as a palindrome, which also excludes it from this sequence."
