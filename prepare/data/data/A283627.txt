        "These are real {0,1} matrices A such that A^2 = J, the all-ones matrix.",
        "It is known that A must have dimension which is a square, so the sequence shows counts for 1 X 1, 4 X 4, 9 X 9, 16 X 16 matrices and so on.",

        "My method was to take the 6 matrices A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 found by Knuth, which are representatives for the 6 distinct orbits of 9 x 9 matrices A such that A^2 = J under the action of the 9! permutation matrices acting by conjugation.",
        "I found for each Ai the size n_i of the stabilizer of Ai. The stabilizer orders are [n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4,n_5,n_6] = [6,2,1,1,2,2], which implies that the cardinality of the union of all orbits is Sum(9!/n_i, i=1..6) = 1330560.",
