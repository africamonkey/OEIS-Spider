        "On the infinite square grid we start at stage 0 with no toothpicks. At stage 1 we place three consecutive toothpicks and two orthogonal toothpicks, as an asymetric cross with four edges of length 1, 2, 3, and 4, then a(1)=5. At stage 2 we place 4 toothpicks. And so on...",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks in the structure after n stages. A160427 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage. See A139250 for more information about toothpick sequences."
