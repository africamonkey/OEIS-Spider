    "name": "Sum of jump-lengths of all even trees with 2n edges. An even tree is an ordered tree in which each vertex has an even outdegree. In the preorder traversal of an ordered tree, any transition from a node at a deeper level to a node on a strictly higher level is called a jump; the positive difference of the levels is called the jump distance; the sum of the jump distances in a given ordered tree is called the jump-length.",
