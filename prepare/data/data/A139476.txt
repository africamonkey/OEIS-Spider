        "The conjecture is false; in the EKG sequence, 158^2 is at position 24142, but 157^2 is at position 24146. Note that 157 is prime. If we let p=157, then the two terms on either side of p^2 are p(p+2) and p(p+3), which is unusual because for all primes 3 < p < 157, the three terms are p(p+1), p^2, p(p+2). The next unusual prime is 661. There are no others less than 8164."
