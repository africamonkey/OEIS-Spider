        "More precisely: minimum value for X=2 of primitive GF(2)[X] polynomials of degree n with exactly 5 terms, or 0 if no such polynomial exists. Applications include maximum-length linear feedback shift registers with efficient implementation in both hardware and software. Proof is needed that there exists a primitive GF(2)[X] polynomial P[X] of degree n and exactly 5 terms for all n>4."
