        "There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between integers N >= 2 and sequences a(x_1),a(x_2),...,a(x_k) of terms from this sequence. Every N >= 2 can be written uniquely as a \"power tower\"",
        "N = a(x_1)^a(x_2)^a(x_3)^...^a(x_k),",
        "where the exponents are to be nested from the right.",
        "Proof: If N is not a perfect power then N = a(x) for some x, and we are done. Otherwise, write N = a(x_1)^M for some M >=2, and repeat the process. QED",
        "Of course, prime numbers also have distinct power towers (see A164336). (End)",
        "These numbers can be computed with a modified Sieve of Eratosthenes: (1) start at n=2; (2) if n is not crossed out, then append n to the sequence and cross out all powers of n; (3) set n = n+1 and go to step 2. - _Sam Alexander_, Dec 15 2003",
