        "The Mathematica program first computes A024940, the number of partitions of n into distinct triangular numbers. Then it finds those n having zero such partitions. It appears that A024940 grows exponentially, which would preclude additional terms in this sequence. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 24 2006, Jan 05 2009"
