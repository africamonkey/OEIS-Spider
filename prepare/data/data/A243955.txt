        "This sequence denotes the position of the Feynman point in the digits of tau = 2*Pi, from a(3) to a(7). Note how compared with A048940, tau has a Feynman point one digit longer, and one position lower, because at this point, the decimal expansion of Pi is 499999987, giving 99999997 when multiplied by 2."
