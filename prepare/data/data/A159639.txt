        "Considering dividend/divisor=quotient, in a(1) of A116536, A159578, and A159579, 3=30/10; sometimes integral quotients appear n times in succession -- see A159580 where a(3)indicates that 5 integral quotients appear one after another. A159581 and A159639 give the first and last values of the divisors producing these integral quotients.",
