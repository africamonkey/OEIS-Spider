        "A novel integer partition is an integer partition with k parts with overall gcd 1 such that there are k-1 linearly independent ways to add up the parts with plus or minus signs and reach zero.",
        "For a novel integer partition, it is always possible to add up the parts with plus or minus signs and reach zero. For this reason, no odd number can be the sum of a novel partition."
