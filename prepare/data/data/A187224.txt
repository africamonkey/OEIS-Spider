        "The notion of the rank transform of a sequence is introduced as follows.  Suppose that a=(a(n)), for n>=1, is a nondecreasing sequence of nonnegative integers, where a(1)<=1, and suppose that b=(b(n)), for n>=1, is an increasing sequence of positive integers.",

        "Assuming a unbounded, let c be the number of a(i)<=1, let c(1)=c+1, and for n>1, let c(n) be the rank of r(n) when all the numbers a(i)<=r(n) and r(1),...,r(n-1), r(n) are jointly ranked.  Then, clearly, a(n)<=r(n)<=c(n) for n>=1, and the sequences r and c are a complementary pair.",
        "What conditions on the sequence a will ensure that R(a) exists?  That is, what conditions will ensure that the counting function in (2) can be determined inductively, so that the recurrence (3) can be used to self-generate the sequence r?  The answer is this:  a(n)<=c(n-1)+1; viz., if a(n)>c(n-1)+1, then c(n-1)+1=r(n), but then a(n)>r(n), a contradiction, but if a(n)<=c(n-1)+1, there is no such obstacle.",

        "Returning now to a and b as above, let (r(1,k)) be the adjusted joint rank sequence (AJRS) of a and b, with a(i) before b(j) when a(i)=b(j).  Let (r(2,k)) be the AJRS of a and (r(1,k)); and inductively, let (r(n,k)) be the AJRS of a and (r(n-1,k)).  If R(a) exists, then the limit of (r(n,k)) is R(a).",
