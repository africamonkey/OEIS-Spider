        "All numbers except the first are squares. Why? - _Zak Seidov_, Jun 10 2005",
        "Answer from Gabe Cunningham (gcasey(AT)MIT.EDU): \"From the fact that the sigma (the sum-of-divisors function) is multiplicative, we can derive that the sigma(n) is even except when n is a square or twice a square.",
        "\"If n = 2(2k+1)^2, that is, n is twice an odd square, then sigma(n) = 3*sigma((2k+1)^2). If n = 2(2k)^2, that is, n is twice an even square, then sigma(n) is only prime if n is a power of 2; otherwise we have sigma(n) = sigma(8*2^m) * sigma(k/2^m) for some positive integer m.",
        "\"So the only possible candidates for values of n other than squares such that sigma(n) is prime are odd powers of 2. But sigma(2^(2m+1)) = 2^(2m+2)-1 = (2^(m+1)+1) * (2^(m+1) - 1), which is only prime when m=0, that is, when n=2. So 2 is the only nonsquare n such that sigma(n) is prime.\"",

        "From Gabe Cunningham's comment it follows that the alternate Mathematica program provided below is substantially more efficient as it only tests squares. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Dec 12 2010",
        "Each number of this sequence is a prime power. This follows from the facts that sigma is multiplicative and sigma(n) > 1 for n > 1. Thus, for n > 1, a(n) is of the form a(n) = k^2 where k = p^m, with p prime, so the divisors of a(n) are {1, p, p^2, p^3, ..., (p^m)^2}, and this set is a multiplicative group (modulo q); if q is prime, q = sigma(k^2). Reciprocally, if q is a prime of the form 1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^(2*m), then q = sigma(p^(2*m)) (definition of sigma). - _Michel Lagneau_, Aug 17 2011, edited by _Franklin T.
