        "In November 1987, an editor at the Astrophysical Journal wrote to _N. J. A. Sloane_ with three sequences whose explanation was not known to her. She said: \"As to the pedigree of these sequences, not much is known. But they are US in origin, and /not/ Hungarian\".  One of the three was the number-theoretical sequence A007468. The other two are now A199714 and A199715."
