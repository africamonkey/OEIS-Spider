        "If {p+q} sums are produced by adding 2 terms of an S set consisting of n different entries, then at least 1, at most n(n+1)/2=A000217(n) distinct values can be obtained. The set of first n primes gives results falling between these two extremes. E.g. S={2,3,5,7,11,13} provides 17 different sums of two, not necessarily different primes: {4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,18,20,22,24,26}. Four sums arise more than once:10=3+7=5+5,14=3+11=7+7, 16=3+13=5+11,18=5+13=7+11. Thus a(6)=(6*7/2)-17=4."
