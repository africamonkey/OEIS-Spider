        "Semiprimes p*q for which there exists r <= q such that r^k <= p <= q < r^(k+1), for some k >= 1, i.e., semiprimes whose both prime factors fit inside a semiopen range of two consecutive powers of some natural number r which itself is not greater than the larger prime factor. If such r exists, then it must be <= p (the smaller prime factor of n), which forces q to be less than p^2. On the other hand, when p <= q < p^2, then setting r = p and k = 1 satisfies the equation r^k <= p <= q < r^(k+1).",
        "Assuming that A054272(n), the number of primes in interval [p(n), p(n)^2], is nondecreasing (implied for example if Legendre's or Brocard's conjecture is true), it follows that for any a(n), A003961(a(n)) is also in sequence. In other words, whenever prime(i)*prime(j) is in the sequence, then so is also prime(i+1)*prime(j+1).",
        "From above would follow also that these are all the \"settled semiprimes\" that occur in a square array A083221 constructed from the sieve of Eratosthenes, from the level A251719 downward. Furthermore, this sequence would then be an infinite disjoint union of sequences of A003961-iterates starting from the initial values given in A251724.",
