        "Ramanujan proved that a) for any prime p, there exist a finite number of highly composite numbers with p as its largest prime factor; and b) in the canonical prime factorization of a highly composite number with largest prime factor p, the exponents for all primes > p are never smaller than they are in the factorization of A003418(p). (See formula 54 of the Ramanujan paper.)",
        "It follows that, if the intersection of A003418 and A116998 is finite, so is the intersection of A002182 and A116998. For proof that the former intersection is finite, see A168262."

    "example": [
        "1) 1680 has more divisors than any smaller positive integer; thus for all m < n, d(1680^1) > d(m^1).",
        "2) Since the exponents in 1680's prime factorization are (4,1,1,1), the k-th power of 1680 has (4k+1)(k+1)^3 = 4k^4 + 13k^3 + 15k^2 + 7k + 1 divisors. Comparison with the analogous formulas for all smaller members of A025487 shows the following:",
        "a) No number smaller than 1680 has a positive coefficient in its \"power formula\" for any exponent larger than k^4.",
        "b) The only power formula with a k^4 coefficient as high as 4 is that for 1260 (4k^4 + 12k^3 + 13k^2 + 6k + 1).",
        "c) The k^3 coefficient for 1680 is higher than for 1260.",
        "So for all sufficiently high values of k, d(1680^k) > d(m^k) for all m < 1680.",
        "3) Careful comparison of 1680's \"power formula\" with the analogous formulas for smaller members of A025487 shows that no intermediate value of k can exist for which d(m^k) >= d(1680^k) if m < 1680."
