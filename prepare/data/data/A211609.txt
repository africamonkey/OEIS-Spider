        "The product 12spt(n) appears in the formula b(n) = 12spt(n)+(24n-1)p(n) which is mentioned in several papers (see Ono's paper, see also Garvan's papers and Garvan's slides in link section). Note that b(n) is A220481(n).",

For the table see Dabholkar-Murthy-Zagier paper, appendix A.1, table of Q_M (weight 2 case), M = 6, C_M = 12. See also the table in page 46. Question: do all terms coincide?"
