        "Each term is the smallest prime p >= 5 such that the differences between the 5 consecutive primes starting with p are (d1,d2,d3,d4), for some quadruple (d1,d2,d3,d4) with elements in {2,4,6}."

        "The term 3299 corresponds to the quadruple (2,6,6,6): 3299, 3301, 3307, 3313, 3319 are consecutive primes."

        "The quadruples are in A078868. The same primes, in lexicographic order of the quadruples, are in A078866. The sequences of primes corresponding to the 26 difference patterns are in A022006, A022007 and A078946-A078970. Cf. A001223."
