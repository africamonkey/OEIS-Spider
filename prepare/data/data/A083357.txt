        "The reference asks \"Let R(n) be the set of all rectangles whose side lengths are natural numbers and whose area is at most n. Find an integer n>1 such that the members of R(n), each used exactly once, tile a square.\". It shows that n=43 is the smallest solution. A necessary condition is that n be in this sequence. Is this also a sufficient condition?",
