        "This is a (possibly) optimal sequence for reverse-sorting an ascending list where N = 32. Requires 3.313*N comparisons. 3.313 is approximately equal to 2.21*log10(32). The operation performed requires a defined, substantial and certainly nontrivial amount of work which is repeatable for a list of any size."
