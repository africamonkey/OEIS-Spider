        "Note that all these primes have the form 6k+1, which is required for the equation x^2+x+1=0 (mod p) to have two integer solutions. However, this sequence has only about half of all 6k+1 primes. What other condition determines the p in this sequence? See A154755 for the primes not in this sequence."
