        "a(n) is the number of length-n \"growth-restricted\" strings over the alphabet {0,1,...,n-1} that are also Lyndon words. A string is \"growth restricted\" if every letter is at most one more than the maximum of all preceding letters, and is enumerated by the Bell numbers (A000110). A string is \"Lyndon\" if it is lexicographically smaller than all its cyclic shifts."
