        "If p is in A001220, then p-1 is in the sequence. If n is in the sequence and n+1 is composite, then any prime factor of n+1 is in A001220 (see fifth comment for a proof). In that case, n+1 could be called a 'Wieferich pseudoprime'.",
        "Any further terms are greater than 1.2 * 10^17. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 12 2014",
        "Both known terms have a periodic binary representation (i.e., 1092 = 010001000100, 3510 = 110110110110), so they are terms of A242139. Also, the ratio between those numbers and their divisor sums is 112/39 in both cases (see Dobson's website in the links and also A239875). Are those facts just coincidences? - _Felix Fr\u00f6hlich_, Apr 15 2014",
        "Proof of second part of second comment above: Let q be any odd prime factor of (n+1). Since 2 and q^2 are coprime, it follows from Euler's totient theorem (also known as Euler's theorem or Fermat-Euler theorem) that 2^(phi(q^2)) == 1 (mod q^2). Writing phi(q^2) = q^2 - q = q(q-1), one gets 2^(q(q-1)) == 1 (mod q^2). Taking the q-th root of both sides of the congruence yields 2^(q-1) == 1 (mod q^2). Q.E.D. - _Felix Fr\u00f6hlich_, Jun 08 2015",
        "If a(3) exists, it corresponds to A001220(3) - 1, i.e., a(3) + 1 must be prime. This can be shown the following way: Assume that a(3) + 1 is composite. Then the theorem from previous comment implies that a(3) + 1 is of the form 1093^x * 3511^y for some x, y >= 0 and x, y not both 0. If x or y is an integer k > 1, then p = 1093 or p = 3511 satisfies 2^(p-1) == 1 (mod p^(2k)). A quick check with PARI shows that neither 1093 nor 3511 satisfies this congruence for any k > 1. This leaves the case where x = y = 1, which can be excluded as well, since 3837523 is not in A001567. Q.E.D. - _Felix Fr\u00f6hlich_, Jun 08 2015"
