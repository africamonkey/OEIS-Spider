        "If for a prime p>=3, n ends with base-p digits a,b with a+b>=p, then for k=(a+1)(p-1), the number n*binomial(n-1,k)*bernoulli(k) is not integer (contains p in the denominator). For p=3, this implies that n == 5, 7, or 8 (mod 9) are not in this sequence; for p=5, this implies that n = 9, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, or 24 (mod 25) are not in this sequence; and so on.

        "Conjecture: for every integer n>78 there exists a prime p such that the sum of last two base-p digits of n is at least p. This conjecture would imply that this sequence is finite and 60 is the last term. The conjecture is true for n such that n+1 is not a prime or a power of 2. [From _Max Alekseyev_, Jun 04 2012]"
