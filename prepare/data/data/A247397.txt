    "comment": [
        "For any number that does not appear on this list, there exists an arrangement of that number of unit-diameter circles that can be enclosed in a rectangle with area of less than 1 square unit per circle.",
        "Any number of unit-diameter circles greater than or equal to 14 can be arranged in two rows, where the upper row is offset by 1/2 horizontally and (sqrt(3/4)-1) vertically, thereby reducing the minimum size of the enclosing rectangle to less than n square units. However, this isn't necessarily the overall minimum.",
        "In addition, 11 unit-diameter circles placed in 3 rows can be enclosed in an area less than 11 square units."

    "example": [
        "11 unit-diameter circles can be placed in a hexagonal array, with rows of 4, 3 and 4 circles in respective rows, which can be enclosed in a rectangle 4 units wide and (1+sqrt(3)) high, giving an area of 10.93, less than 11 square units. Any fewer circles than this, and also 12 or 13 circles, cannot be enclosed in a rectangle smaller than n square units in area."
