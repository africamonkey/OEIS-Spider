        "The elements of S_n are (i) the unity, (ii) the involutions (elements of order 2), counted in A001189, and (iii) elements that have at least one cycle of order >=3 in their cycle representation as a permutation, counted in A066052.",
        "For elements of order >=3 we can show that they can be represented as a product of two involutions. [Proof: Write down the reduced cycle representation of the element. Decompose each sub-cycle of order >=3 into a product of two involutions, and distribute/merge the 1 or 2 factors of the involutions. For sub-cycles of order o>=3 it suffices to show that the reduced cycle (1 2 3 4 ... o), equivalent to the 1-line representation (2 3 4 .. o 1), can be written as a product of 2 involutions, because other cycles are mapped to such a product by a fixed permutation. A constructive proof here is: the reduced cycle (1 2 3 4 ... o) is the product of the two involutions (1 2)(3 o)(4 o-1)(5 o-2)... and (2 o)(3 o-1)... The first involution swaps the first two elements and reverts the ordering of all others from the 3rd on, then the second involution reverts the order of the elements from the 2nd on. The net effect is a cyclic shift of the o elements.] - _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 04 2017"
