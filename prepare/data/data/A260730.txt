        "Numbers n such that when the exponents in the prime factorization of A097706(n) are added in base-2 they produce at least one carry-bit. In other words, in that set of exponents {e1, e2, ..., en} there is at least one pair e_i, e_j that their binary representations have at least one 1-bit in the same position. (Here i and j are distinct as e_i and e_j are exponents of different primes, although e_i could be equal to e_j. See the examples.)",
        "This differs from A119973 for the first time at n=30 where a(30)=231, term which is not present in A119973. Note that n=231 is the first position where the difference A065339(n) - A260728(n) > 1 as 231 = 3*7*11, a product of three distinct 4k+3 primes, thus A065339(231) = 3, while A260728(231) = 1."
