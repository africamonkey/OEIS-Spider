        "The sequence also counts order ideals (or antichains) of the binary majorization lattice with 2^n points. That lattice for n=5 will be illustrated in Fig. 8 of Volume 4 of The Art of Computer Programming. The basic properties of this lattice will be discussed in exercise 7.1.1-109 of that book. (The material of Section 7.1.1 will be available in paperback in a couple months.)",
