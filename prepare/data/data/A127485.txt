Corresponding primes of the form n^3 + (n+1)^2 are listed in A100662(n) = {5, 17, 43, 89, 593, 829, 2393, 2969, 3631, 5237, ...}. Note that there are many consecutive twins, triplets and quadruplets in A127483(n). For example: (1,2,3,4), {8,9}, {13,14,15}, {22,23,24,25}, {34,35}, {38,39}, {64,65}, {98,99,100}.
