        "Essentially rewrites in binary expansion of n each 0 -> 01, 1X -> 1(rewrite X)0, where X is the maximal suffix after the 1-bit, which will be rewritten recursively (see the given Scheme-function). Because of this, the terms of the binary length 2n are counted by 2's powers, A000079.",
        "In rooted plane (general) tree context, these are those totally balanced binary sequences (terms of A014486) where non-leaf subtrees can occur only as the rightmost branch (at any level of a general tree), but nowhere else. (Cf. A209642).",
        "Also, these are exactly those rooted plane trees whose \u0141ukasiewicz words happen to be valid asynchronous siteswap juggling patterns. (This was the original, albeit quite frivolous definition of this sequence for almost ten years 2002-2012. Cf. A071160.)"
