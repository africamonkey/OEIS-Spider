The sets U and V are disjoint, and their union, arranged as a sequence in increasing order, is A274429.  (Unlike A274426, here all the Lucas numbers except 1 are included.)",

This is the concatenation of v and the words (v^k)(u^k)(v^k)(u^k) for k >= 1.  Thus, there are runs of Fibonacci products of every finite length and runs of Lucas products of every finite length.",
