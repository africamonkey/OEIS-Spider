        "B(n) is the set of lattice paths of weight n that start in (0,0), end on the horizontal axis and never go below this axis, whose steps are of the following four kinds: h = (1,0) of weight 1, H = (1,0) of weight 2, u = (1,1) of weight 2, and d = (1,-1)  of weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.",
        "A weak peak in a lattice path is a vertex on the top of a hump. A hump is an upstep followed by 0 or more flatsteps followed by a downstep. For example, the weighted lattice path Hu*duu*h*H*dd has 4 weak peaks (shown by the stars).",
