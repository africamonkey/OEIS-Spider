        "If x and y are two consecutive prime numbers (x < y), Euclid's algorithm gives integers t and d such that tx+dy = 1 = gcd(x, y). The algorithm \"Anomalia\" gives t and d such that |t+d| is as small as possible (it is often = 1). The prime number x is 'anomalous' iff |t+d| > 1 for x and y.",
