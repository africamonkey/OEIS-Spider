        "The g.f. is Z(C_6,x)/x^6, the 6-variate cycle index polynomial for the cyclic group C_6, with substitution x[i]->1/(1-x^i), i=1,...,6. Therefore by Polya enumeration a(n+6) is the number of cyclically inequivalent 6-necklaces whose 6 beads are labeled with nonnegative integers such that the sum of labels is n, for n=0,1,2,... See A102190 for Z(C_6,x). Note the equivalence of this formulation with the one given as this sequence's name: start with a black 6-necklace (all 6 beads have labels 0). Insert after each of the 6 black beads k white ones if the label was k and then disregard the labels. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 15 2005",
        "The g.f. of the CIK[k] transform of the sequence (b(n): n>=1), which has g.f. B(x) = Sum_{n>=1} b(n)*x^n, is CIK[k](x) = (1/k)*Sum_{d|k} phi(d)*B(x^d)^{k/d}. Here, k = 6, b(n) = 1 for all n >= 1, and B(x) = x/(1-x), from which we get another proof of the g.f.s given below. - _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jan 07 2018"

        "We explain why a(8) = 4. According to the theory of transforms by C. G. Bower, given in the weblink above, a(8) is the number of ways of arranging 6 indistinct unlabeled boxes (that may differ only in their size) as a necklace, on a circle, such that the total number of balls in all of them is 8. There are 4 ways for doing that on a circle: 311111, 221111, 212111, and 211211.",
        "To translate these configurations of boxes into necklaces with 8 beads, 6 of them black and 2 of them white, we modify an idea given above by W. Lang. We replace each box that has m balls with a black bead followed by m-1 white beads. The four examples above become BWWBBBBB, BWBWBBBB, BWBBWBBB, and BWBBBWBB.",
