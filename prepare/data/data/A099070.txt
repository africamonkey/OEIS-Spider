        "If n is in the sequence and n+1 is prime then n+1 is also in the sequence. Next term is greater than 5450 and the prime corresponding to the next term has more than 18000 digits. Number of digits of primes corresponding to the nine known terms of the sequence are respectively 2,2,3,3,4,5,29,5010 & 5010."
