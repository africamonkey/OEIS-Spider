    "comment": [
        "A233696 gives rules for constructing the Gaussian rationals in generations as follows:  g(1) = {0}, and for n > 1, if x is in g(n-1) then x+1, i*x, and 1/x (for x not 0) are in g(n), except for those that are in g(j) for some j < n.  Conjecture:  2 < lim(|g(n+1)|/|g(n)|) < 3."
