        "Up to n=4 the only permutation that can't be sorted is 2341.  This fails because after moving 2 to one stack, you must move 3 to the other stack, and now the 4 will block either the 2 or the 3.  (If you use a double-ended queue instead of two stacks, then this permutation becomes sortable: Cf. A182216.)"
