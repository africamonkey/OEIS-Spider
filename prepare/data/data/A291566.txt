    "comment": [
        "A positive integer, n, is a balanced number (A020492) if sigma(n) is a multiple of phi(n). Since phi and sigma are multiplicative functions, if m and n are balanced numbers and gcd(m,n)=1, mn is also a balanced number. This sequence consists of only these imprimitive terms."

        "2 and 3 are balanced numbers, gcd(2,3)=1, so 6 is a non-primitive balanced number."
