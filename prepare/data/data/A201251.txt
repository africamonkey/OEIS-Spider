    "comment": [
        "Prime septuplets (p, p+2, p+8, p+12, p+14, p+18, p+20) are one of the two types of densest permissible constellations of 7 primes (A022009 and A022010). Average gaps between prime k-tuples can be deduced from the Hardy-Littlewood k-tuple conjecture and are O(log^k(p)), with k=7 for septuplets. If a gap is larger than any preceding gap, we call it a maximal gap, or a record gap. Maximal gaps may be significantly larger than average gaps; this sequence suggests that maximal gaps are O(log^8(p)).",
        "A201252 lists initial primes in septuplets (p, p+2, p+8, p+12, p+14, p+18, p+20) preceding the maximal gaps. A233038 lists the corresponding primes at the end of the maximal gaps."

    "formula": [
        "Gaps between prime septuplets (p, p+2, p+8, p+12, p+14, p+18, p+20) are smaller than 0.02*(log p)^8, where p is the prime at the end of the gap. There is no rigorous proof of this formula. The O(log^8(p)) growth rate is suggested by numerical data and heuristics based on probability considerations."

    "example": [
        "The gap of 83160 between septuplets starting at p=5639 and p=88799 is the very first gap, so a(1)=83160. The gap of 195930 between septuplets starting at p=88799 and p=284729 is a maximal gap - larger than any preceding gap; therefore a(2)=195930. The next gap of 341880 is again a maximal gap, so a(3)=341880. The next gap is smaller, so it does not contribute to the sequence."
