        "Conjecture: (i) All the terms are even. Moreover, if x and y are positive integers with phi(x)*sigma(y) = 2*x*y, then y must be even.",
        "(ii) If x and y are positive integers with phi(x)*sigma(y) = 2*x*y, then x = 1 or 3 | y. Thus, any term of the sequence is either a perfect number or a multiple of three.",
        "As phi(1) = 1, the sequence contains all perfect numbers, and part (i) of the above conjecture implies the well-known conjecture that there are no odd perfect numbers.",
