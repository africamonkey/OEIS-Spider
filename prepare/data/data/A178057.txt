This is the 2nd row of an infinite array A[k,n] = Smallest k-almost prime number > a(n-1) that contains the n-th prime number as a substring. This is one plane of the infinite 3-D array A[j,k,n] = Smallest k-almost prime number > a(n-1) that contains the n-th prime number as a substring in base j representation."
