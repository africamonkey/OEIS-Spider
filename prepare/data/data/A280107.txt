        "Let  n = 2^k * t where k >= 0 and t is odd, and let D be the set of divisors of t less than r(n) = floor((sqrt(8*n+1) - 1)/2). The following statements are equivalent:",
        "(1)  There is exactly one d in D such that 2^(k+1) * d < e where e in D is the next odd divisor larger than d, and the largest divisor f in D satisfies 2^(k+1) * f <= r(n).",
        "(2)  The symmetric representation of sigma(n) consists of four parts.",
        "The property says that the first part of the symmetric representation of n consists of the first 2^(k+1) * d - 1 legs and that the second part starts with leg e and ends with leg 2^(k+1) * f - 1 before or at the middle of the Dyck path (see A237048 and A249223) on the diagonal. Together with their symmetric pair they form the four parts. (End)"
