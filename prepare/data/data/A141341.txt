        "As Browers et al. point out, A141340 = A141341 union {7,14,16,36,42,48,60,90,210}, A020490 = A141341\\{5} and A048597 = A141341\\{5,10}. The authors show that the first strategy of Deshouillers et al. to establish a bound (of 10^520) for A141340 is sufficient for then determining the totally Goldbach numbers and \"leads us naturally to interesting questions concerning primes in a fixed residue class\"."
