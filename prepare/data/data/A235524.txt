        "To be \"primitive\", the set of prime factors of N and of d(N) must be identical, otherwise any prime only in N is arbitrary and this defines a family of refactorable numbers.  These are referred to as generators in the Zelinsky reference.",
        "This sequence is therefore the intersection of the refactorable numbers (A033950) and those numbers with identical sets of prime factors for N and d(N) (A081381).",
        "The first numbers in A081381 which are not in this sequence are 486, 768, 8748, and 303750.  This sequence is A235525."
