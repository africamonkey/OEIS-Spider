    "comment": [
        "The Artin transfer homomorphisms of the assigned 3-class tower group G with SmallGroups identifier <81,7> [Besche, Eick, O'Brien], which is better known as the 3-Sylow subgroup Syl_3(A_9) of the alternating group of degree 9, determine the capitulation type (2,0,0,0) (TKT without fixed point) of the real quadratic field K in its four unramified cyclic cubic extensions N_i|K (i=1,...,4) and the abelian type invariants of the 3-class groups Cl(3,K)=(3,3) (whence A269321 is a subsequence of A269319) and [Cl(3,N_i)]=[(3,3,3),(3,3),(3,3),(3,3)] (TTT or IPAD). Conversely, the group G=<81,7> is determined uniquely not only by its Artin pattern AP(G)=(TTT,TKT) but even by the TTT component alone [Mayer, 2014, Fig.3.1, Tbl.4.1], where TKT, TTT, IPAD are abbreviations for transfer kernel type, transfer target type, index-p abelianization data, respectively [Mayer, 2016]. Consequently, it suffices that the MAGMA program only determines the TTT component of the Artin pattern. This is an instance of the \"Principalization algorithm via class group structure\" [Mayer, 2014] and saves a considerable amount of CPU time, since the determination of the TKT component is very delicate. In fact, G=<81,7> is the unique finite 3-group of coclass cc(G)=1 with a component (3,3,3) in its IPAD. Since the group G=<81,7> has derived length dl(G)=2, the Hilbert 3-class field tower of these real quadratic fields consists of exactly two stages.",
