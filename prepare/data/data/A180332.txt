        "A number is called a primitive Zumkeller number if it is a Zumkeller number (A083207) but none of its proper divisors are Zumkeller numbers. These numbers are very similar to primitive non-deficient numbers (A006039), but neither is a subsequence of the other.",
        "Because every Zumkeller number has a divisor that is a primitive Zumkeller number, every Zumkeller number z can be factored as z = d*r, where d is the smallest divisor of z that is a primitive Zumkeller number.",
        "Every number of the form p*2^k is a primitive Zumkeller number, where p is an odd prime and k = floor(log2(p))."
