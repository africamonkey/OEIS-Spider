    "comment": [
        "For n>=4, a maximal set can be chosen by taking all irreducible polynomials of degree n, the squares of all irreducible polynomials of degree n/2 (if n is even) and, for each irreducible polynomial p of degree d with 1 <= d < n/2, a product p*q where q is irreducible of degree n-d. The q's should all be distinct, which is possible when n>=4."
