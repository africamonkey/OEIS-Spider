        "P(2) = 5 is the only prime pentagonal number, all other factor as P(k) = (k/2)*(3*k-1) or k*((3*k-1)/2) and thus have at least 2 prime factors. P(k) is semiprime iff [k prime and (3*k-1)/2 prime] or [k/2 prime and 3*k-1 prime]. A115709 is pentagonal numbers (A000326) whose digit reversal is a semiprime (A001358)."
