        "These values have been computed empirically. An independent recomputation or a mathematical proof would be welcome. The initial terms factored: 2, 2*2, 2*3, 2*2*2*3*3, 2*2*7*3*5, 2*2*2*3*3*3*3*5, ..."

If we sum the period length prefixes of these sequences, as Sum_{i=1..a(1)} A010684(i), Sum_{i=1..a(2)} A112132(i), Sum_{i=1..a(3)} A112133(i), etc., we get the sequence 4, 12, 60, 420, 4620, 60060, 1021020, ... (cf. A097250) and when doubled, it yields: 8, 24, 120, 840, 9240, 120120, 2042040, ... (cf. A066631 and A102476)."
