Choosing d carefully serves as a basis for two types of adjusted joint rankings of non-disjoint sets {u*i^p} and {v*j^q}.",
        "First, if we place u*i^p before v*j^q whenever u*i^p=v*j^q, then with 0<d<1, a(n) and b(n) are the ranks of u*n^p and v*j^q, respectively.  For the second type, if we place u*i^p after v*j^q whenever u*i^p=v*j^q, then with -1<d<0, a(n) and b(n) are ranks of u*n^p and v*j^q, respectively.",
        "More generally, if u=h/k and v=s/t are positive rational numbers in lowest terms, then a(n) and b(n) are the respective ranks of u*n^p and v*n^q, adjusted as described above, according as d=1/(2kq) or d=-1/(2kq).  Examples: A186148-A186159."
