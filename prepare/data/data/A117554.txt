    "comment": [
        "We may define the p-limit Pepper ambiguity, for any odd prime p, as the maximum of the ratios of the errors of the nearest approximation to the members of the p-limit tonality diamond to the next nearest. In the 5-limit, that means we look at the ratios of the errors for the nearest approximations to 3/2, 5/4 and 5/3 to the next nearest.",
        "The 3-limit version of this is A005664, so in some sense this is a generalization of that. However it is also very closely related to A054540."
