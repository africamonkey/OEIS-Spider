        "These pseudofactors although not unique sets as their domains seem to overlap form twelve subsets of primes based on the first digit set {1,3,7,9} when {2,5} are taken away from the prime set. I'm entering the four {1}'s sets. There exist {3}'s, {7}'s and {9}'s sets of these same four types."
