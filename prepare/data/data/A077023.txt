        "Remainder, a(n), when sum of first n primes squared is divided by n-th prime in A072004. In A077023, 5 values of n such that a(n)=0 are given. In the sequence, the corresponding integer values of sum of first n primes squared divided by n-th prime are given. For primes <100,000,000, there are no other cases of a(n)=0."
