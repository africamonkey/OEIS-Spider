    "comment": [
        "This problem is also known as the linear arrangement problem or the wire-length problem. The task is to label the vertices of a graph with distinct positive integers such that the sum of label differences over all the edges is minimal. More formally, given a finite simple graph G=(V,E) with vertex set V and edge set E, we need to find a map f from V onto {1,2, ..., |V|} that minimizes the sum |f(u) - f(v)| over all edges (u,v) in E. In general this problem is NP-hard, but exact solutions are known for rectangular grids. This sequence corresponds to optimal solutions for n X n square grids."
