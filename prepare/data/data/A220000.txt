        "Diameter of successive drill bits, in thousandths of an inch, within an ordered set consisting of increments of 1/64th of an inch. Traditionally the sizes of bits in such a set are expressed in simplest reduced fractional inch values: 1/64, 1/32, 3/64, 1/16, etc. Of fundamental importance to machinists, tool and die makers, carpenters, hobbyists, insomnial science teachers, etc."
