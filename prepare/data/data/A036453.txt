        "The iterated d function rapidly converges to fixed point 2. In the 5th iterated d-sequence the first term different from the fixed point 2 appears at n=5040. The 6th and further iterated sequences have very long initial segment of 2's. In the 6th one the first non-stationary term is a(293318625600)=3. In such sequences any large value occurs infinite many times and constructible.",
