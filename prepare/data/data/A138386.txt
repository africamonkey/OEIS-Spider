        "Below we show that for j >= 1, a(j) = T(m, 3m + j) = T(j, 4j).",
        "An m-partition of n = 3m + j has at least m-j parts 3. Suppose that p is an m-partition of n with m-j-1 parts 3. The sum of the parts of p is at least n+1 since 3(m-j-1) + 4(m - (m-j-1)) = 3(m-j-1) + 4m -4(m-j-1) = 4m - (m-j-1) = 4m-m+j+1 = (3m + j) + 1.",
        "Because any m-partition of n = 3m + j has at least m-j parts 3, we obtain all the m-partitions of 3m + j if we append m-j parts 3 to each one of the j-partitions of 4j. Note that n - 3(m-j) = 4j and m - (m-j) = j.",
        "To complete we note that C(f(3) + K_3 - 1, K_3) = C(K_3, K_3) = 1 and the values taken by the product pi{3 <= i <= n}C(f(i) + K_i - 1, K_i) do not change when we add m-j to K_3. In fact pi{3 <= i <= n}C(f(i) + K_i - 1, K_i) = pi{4 <= i <= n}C(f(i) + K_i - 1, K_i).",
        "Using results found in the Knuth reference on pp. 9, ..., it is not difficult to show that the number of j-partitions of 4j is equal to p(j), (where p(n) is the usual partition function).",
        "The largest part that appears in those partitions is j+3, because j+4+3(j-1) = 4j+1. So the first 27 values of this sequence are showed. Note that f(k) is known for k <= 29 and we work with 1 <= j <= 26.",
        "With small values of 3m+j, the identity T(m, 3m+j) = T(j, 4j) comes closer to permit us to enumerate all the graphs with M components and N vertices, ie., N >= 3, M >= 1. For example we determine T(M, 100) for M >= 25, T(M, 50) for M >= 8, T(M, 38) for M >= 4, T(M, 35) for M >= 3 and T(M, 32) for M >= 2. All graphs are determined if N <= 29.",
