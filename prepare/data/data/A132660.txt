        "Also of note is the unique number 314, which together with its sixth power 958468597212736 has the property that each digit from 1 to 9 occurs exactly twice. Aside from trivial cases that use zeroth powers, these are all the cases where two numbers that are powers of the same base have this property. [Comment corrected by Tanya Khovanova, Dec 18 2007]",
