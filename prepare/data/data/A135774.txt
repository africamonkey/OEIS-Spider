        "Since 4 is not a prime, no element > 1 of the sequence A000302(k)=4^k (having k+1 digits in base 4 but 2k+1 divisors) can be member of this sequence. However all powers of 5 up to 5^6 are in this sequence, having the same number of digits (in base 4) than the same power of 4 (since (5/4)^6 < 4 < (5/4)^7) and also that number of divisors."
