        "A000045 INTERSECT A011540 is a subsequence. As a consequence of Carmichael's theorem, the product of the digits of terms in the sequence must be in the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 21, 144} and if a term is zeroless (A052382), then at most 6 digits are not equal to 1. Conjecture: all terms > 21 have a 0 digit, i.e. is a member of A011540. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Mar 12 2016"
