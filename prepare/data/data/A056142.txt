        "For 0 < n < 100, a(n) = A056525(n). If n has 3 digits, then a(n) is a palindrome if and only if n is. If n has 4 or 5 digits, then a(n) is a palindrome if and only if all digits of n are equal. - _David Wasserman_, May 23 2005",
        "Conjecture: if n has 3 or more digits, a(n) is a palindrome only if all the digits of n are the same. It is easy to see that any palindrome can have at most 2 distinct digits: matching digits from the initial n in the concatenation matches each digit after the second with an earlier digit. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Sep 07 2006"
