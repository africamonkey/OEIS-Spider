        "If n >> 1 the structure looks like a right triangle, which is essentially half of one of the six wedges of the E-toothpick (or snowflake) structure of A161330. The sequence gives the number of E-toothpicks in the structure after n stages. A211976 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage."
