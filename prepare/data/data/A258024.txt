        "It is stated in the Comments in A000503 that in Floor(tan(n)) \"Every integer appears infinitely often. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Aug 06 2012\".",
        "It is conjectured that applying the function floor(tan) k times, with k sufficiently large, on the finite sequence floor(tan(n)), n=0...N, the result is a sequence (cf. A258021) composed only of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s for all values of N.",
        "The original definition was: \"Numbers n with property that floor(tan(n)) reduces to 1 (instead of 0) when the function is applied repeatedly to n with deep enough nesting level.\" If the conjecture above is true, then the new, in theory more inclusive definition produces exactly the same sequence. It has been checked that for at least up to A249836(13) = 1108341089274117551 there are no other strictly positive fixed points beside 1. - _Antti Karttunen_, May 26 2015",
