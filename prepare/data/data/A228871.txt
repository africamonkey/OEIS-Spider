        "Sequence A198584 gives the first term of the Collatz sequence having exactly 3 odd numbers. This sequence is the subset of A198584 for which the second odd number is larger than the first. The second odd number is (2^(6*n - 2) - 1)/3, which always occurs as the third term of the sequence."
