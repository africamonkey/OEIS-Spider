        "_Andrew Plewe_, May 18 2007, observed that the sequence defined by a(n) = ceiling(n*(1+1/sqrt(2))) appeared to give the same numbers as the sequence, originally due to _Clark Kimberling_, Jul 01 2006, defined by: numbers m such that {rm} > {r}, where r=2^(1/2). The following proof that these sequences are indeed the same is due to _David Applegate_.",
        "First, suppose m satisfies {rm} > {r}. Define n := 2m - [rm] - 1 = m (2-r) + {rm} - 1",
        "Then n is integer and n (1 + 1/r) = m-1 + {rm}(1+1/r) - 1/r.",
        "Now {rm} < 1 so {rm}(1+1/r)-1/r < 1. And {rm}>{r}=r-1, so {rm}(1+1/r)-1/r > (r-1)(1+1/r)-1/r = 0. Thus ceil(n (1+1/r)) = m-1+ceil({rm}(1+1/r) - 1/r) = m. So m is in the sequence.",
        "Conversely, let m be in the sequence, that is, there exists n such that m = ceil(n(1 + 1/r)) = ceil(n + [n/r] + {n/r}) = n + [n/r] + 1.",
        "Then mr = rn + [n/r]r + r = r(r-1)(n/r-[n/r]) + r + n + 2[n/r] = r(r-1){n/r} + r + n + 2[n/r] and, since 0 < {n/r} < 1, r < r(r-1){n/r} + r < r^2=2, which implies {mr} = {r(r-1){n/r}+r} > {r}."
