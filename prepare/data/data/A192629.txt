        "Fermat gave the integer Diophantine m-tuple 1, 3, 8, 120 (see A030063): 1 + the product of any two distinct terms is a square. Euler added the rational number 777480/8288641.",
        "It is unknown whether this rational Diophantine m-tuple can be extended by another rational number. Herrmann, Pethoe, and Zimmer proved that the sequence is finite, but no bound on its length is known.",
        "Denominators are A192630.",
        "See A030063 for additional comments, references, and links."
