    "comment": [
        "The Greenfields show that the integers from 1 to 2n can always be paired to form n (not necessarily distinct) primes. A greedy algorithm, starting with 2n, quickly finds the n primes. Interestingly, as n increases, the set of primes produced by this algorithm forms a stable set of prime numbers. Why?"
