    "comment": [
        "Additional rule: If there are fewer than k=4 digits so far, then the sequence is \"extended to the left\" with the first digit. (It might have been more natural to \"extend\" with digits 1, i.e., to reduce k to the number of digits if there are less than 4.)",
        "Apart from the trivial cycles (0) and (1) and the cycle (175) considered here, the rule also allows for the \"constant\" cycle (384), cf. A239722, and (128), cf. A240967.",
        "In general, such \"constant\" cycles for k=4 (other than the trivial (0) and (1)) must consist in a 3-digit number (100a+10b+c), a,b,c>0, such that a = (10b+c)/(b*c^2-100). The only solutions are:  a=1, b=2, c=8;  a=1, b=7, c=5;  a=3, b=8, c=4. - _Bob Selcoe_, Aug 04 2014"
