    "comment": [
        "The building exceptional group symmetry sequence in Cartan notation is ( Deligne-Landsberg): {A1,A2,G2,D4,F4,E6,E7,E7.5,E8,E9} The Coxeter number seem to be related to the total powers in the elliptical invariants for exceptional groups. I have used 2/11 for the F4 critical exponent instead of Bulgadaev's 1/4 because 2/11 fits the linearity of the groups better."
