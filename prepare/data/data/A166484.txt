        "One can have a prime sum of two Fermat Primes, starting with 2 + 3 = 5.",
        "Hence this current sequence is a proper subset of prime sums of a Fermat prime number of Fermat numbers, which in turn is a proper subset of prime sums of a Fermat number of Fermat numbers.",

        "At least one of the three Fermat numbers must be 3 because all Fermat numbers greater than 3 are equal to 2 (mod 3). Hence, the sum of three Fermat numbers greater than 3 is always a multiple of 3.",
