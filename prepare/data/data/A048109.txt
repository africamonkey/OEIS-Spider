        "For these terms the number of divisors should be a special power of two because ud(n)=2^r and nud(n)=ud(n). In particular the exponent of 2 is 1+A001221(n), the number of distinct prime factors + 1. Thus this is a subsequence of A036537 where A000005(A036537(n)) = 2^s; here s=1+A001221(n).",
        "Let us introduce a function D(n)=sigma_0(n)/(2^(alpha(1)+...+alpha(r)), sigma_0(n) number of divisors of n (A000005), prime factorization of n=p(1)^alpha(1) * ... * p(r)^alpha(r), alpha(1)+...+alpha(r) is sequence (A086436). This function splits the set of positive integers into subsets, according to the value of D(n). Squarefree numbers (A005117) has D(n)=1, other numbers are \"deviated\" from the squarefree ideal and have 0 < D(n) < 1. So for D(n)=1/2 we have A048109, D(n)=3/4 we have A067295. - _Ctibor O.
