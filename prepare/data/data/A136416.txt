        "Iff the trinomial T(x)=1+x^k+x^n is irreducible (A073571) then the polynomial T(x+1)=1+(x+1)^k+(1+x)^n is irreducible.",
        "The order of T(x+1) is in general different from the order of T(x).",
        "So this sequence is different from A073726: for example, 1+(x+1)^7+(1+x)^10 is primitive but 1+(x+1)^3+(1+x)^10 is not (while 1+x^7+x^10 and 1+x^3+x^10 are mutual reciprocal and have the same order)."
