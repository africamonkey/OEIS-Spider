        "John von Neumann et al. used ENIAC to compute 2037 digits of Pi in 1949, a calculation that took 70 hours. As of Jan 2010, the record is almost 2.7 trillion digits. The symbol for the pi was first put into use by mathematician William Jones in 1706, but only became famous after Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler used it in 1737."
