        "For an odd number C to be in the sequence, the divisors must be odd, even, odd,..,odd. So only C=1 is possible, because odd numbers do not have even divisors. This excludes numbers ==1 (mod 4) and == 3 (mod 4) from the sequence (with 1 the only exception).",
        "If some number C (a candidate for the sequence) is a multiple of 4, C=4*k, it surely has divisors {1, 2, 3, 4 , ..., k, ..., 2k, 4k} because 1, 2 and 4 are divisors (also 3 sandwiched between 2 and 4). The two largest divisors would be 2k and 4k, both even, and this violates the odd-even rule. So no C ==0 (mod 4) exists in the sequence, and the sequence contains 1 plus a subsequence of A016825.",
