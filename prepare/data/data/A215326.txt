        "Note: for n = -2 the formula becomes (m - 3), and for n = -9 it becomes (m + 158), so all the Poulet numbers have at least these integer solutions to this formula.",
        "Another interesting observation about the integer solutions: for n = -1 the formula becomes (9*m - 26), and 37 of the first 100 Poulet numbers can be written this way! This means that, for more than a third of Poulet numbers P checked, it is true that (P + 8) is divisible by 9 (for comparison, this relation is true for just 14 of the first 100 primes)."
