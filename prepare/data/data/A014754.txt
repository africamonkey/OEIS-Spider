        "Primes p such that x^4 == 2 has more than two (in fact four) solutions mod p. This is the sequence of terms common to A040098 (primes p such that x^4 == 2 has a solution mod p) and A007519 (primes of form 8n+1). Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p - 1. For p > 2, i is a solution mod p of x^4 == 2 iff p - i is a solution mod p of x^4 == 2, thus the sum of first and fourth solution is p and so is the sum of second and third solution. The solutions are given in A065909, A065910, A065911 and A065912. - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Nov 28 2001",
