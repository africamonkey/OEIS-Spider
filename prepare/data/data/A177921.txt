        "For each n there is a list of floor{n/2} rhombs, a four sided parallelogram with principal index a number from {1,2,....floor{n/2}}. Such rhombs can tile an (n,k)-oval. An (n,k)-oval is a centro-symmetric polygon with 2k sides and contains k(k-1)/2 rhombs.  The regular 2n-gon {2n} with 2n sides is an (n,n)-oval. Its rhombs can be partitioned into (n,k)-ovals for various values of k. This partition is called an oval-partition of {2n}. a(n) is the number of oval-partitions of {2n}."
