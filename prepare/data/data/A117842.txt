        "Bertrand's [1845] postulate as proved by Chebyshev [1850] is versified: \"Chebyshev said it, but I'll say it again; There's always a prime between n and 2n.\" [N. J. Fine in Schechter, 1998]. This sequence is the partial sum of the least such primes. It differs from A007504 \"sum of first n primes\" because of the repetitions in A007918."
