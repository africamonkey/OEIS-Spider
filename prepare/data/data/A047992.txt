    "comment": [
        "Take a deck of n cards, cut into two nonempty piles, then do a riffle-shuffle in which no more than 2 consecutive cards fall from the same half. Sequence gives number of distinct n-permutations that result."

    "formula": [
        "For n>3, a(n) = 2 * F(n+1), with F(n) = A000045(n)."

    "example": [
        "a(4)=10 because we can split the deck as 1|234 then shuffle to get 2134 or 2314, or split as 12|34 and get 3421 1324 1342 3124 3142 or split 123|4 and get 1243, 1423. These plus the identity (1234) give 10 permutations in all."
