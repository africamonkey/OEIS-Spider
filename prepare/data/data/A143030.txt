    "comment": [
        "x is an element of this sequence if when m is the least natural number such that the least positive residue of x mod m! is no more than (m-2)!, Floor[x/(m!)] and Floor[x/(m*(m!))] are congruent to m-1 mod m, but Floor[x/((m^2)*(m!))] is not. The sequence is made up of the residue classes 7 mod 16; 50 and 104 mod 162; 364, 366, 748, 750, 1132 and 1134 mod 1536, etc. A set of such sequences with entries for each zeta(k) - 1 partitions the integers. See the linked paper for their construction."
