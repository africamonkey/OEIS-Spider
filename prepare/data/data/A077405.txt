        "Base 3 analog of A075252 (base 2), A075421 (base 4) and A063048 (base 10); subsequence of A077404. - A proof that the base 3 trajectory does not contain a palindrome has been found up to now for none of the terms. - If the trajectory of an integer k joins the trajectory of a smaller integer which is a term of the present sequence, then this occurs after very few Reverse and Add! steps (at most 9 for k < 20000). On the other hand, the trajectories of the terms of this sequence do not join the trajectory of any smaller term within at least 1000 steps."
