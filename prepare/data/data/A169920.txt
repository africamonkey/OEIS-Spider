        "How should the carry digits be handled? In this version they have been handled by simply adding them in the old way, which is a bit worrisome. For example, in the calculation below, when the column containing 5 and 4 is \"added\", i.e. multiplied, there is a carry of 2, which here has been added to the 1 to get 3."
