        "Ordered even legs of primitive Pythagorean triangles.",
        "I wrote an arithmetic program once to find out if and when y 'catches up to' n in A120427 (ordered even legs of primitive Pythagorean triples). It's around 16700. As enumerated by the even - or odd - legs, (not sure about the hypotenuses), the triples are 'denser' than the integers. - Stephen Waldman, Jun 12 2007"
