        "A109820 can be decomposed into 30 sequences. These 30 associated sequences can be inferred from the 30 ways of partitioning the number nine: 9 81 72 63 54 ... the complete listing is available in the Handbook of Mathematical Functions (1964) p. 831. Consider, for example, the three ways of partitioning the number three: 3, 21 and 111; prepend each partition then add one to each value - yielding 44, 332 and 2222. These \"associated\" partitions are then used to derive the associated sequences. 44 => A000330, 332 => A006011 and 2222 => A034263. Summing these three sequences yields A089574."
