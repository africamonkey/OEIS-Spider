        "From T(k)+T(k+1) = (k*(k+1)+(k+1)*(k+2))/2 = (k+1)^2 any two consecutive triangular numbers sum to a square, the above sequence gives the sums that are also triangular. The units digit cycles through 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 9, 0, 5, ...",
        "Let P(b,e) be the polynomial 1+4*b+4*b^2+4*e+4*e^2. It appears that sequences A076708 and A076049 are special cases of the sequence of integers b such that P(b,b+n) is a perfect square. A076708 and A076049 for example are respectively the sequences of b's such that P(b,b+1) and P(b,b+2) are perfect squares. In fact it appears to be true that the sequence of integers b such that P(b,b+n) is a perfect square has the property that t(b)+t(b+n) is a triangular number. I have not had time to prove this but I do have evidence produced by Mathematica to support the assertion. - Robert Phillips (bobanne(AT)bellsouth.net), Sep 04 2009; corrected Sep 08 2009"
