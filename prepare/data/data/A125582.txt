        "The sequence in base 12 is 1, 10, 26, 3X, 6E, 777, XXE, 3577777799, where X is 10 and E is 11. I have searched numbers up to 24 digits in base 12 excluding any numbers that might contain the digit 1 or any combination of digits that might multiply to 0 mod 12. The numbers also had digits in nondecreasing order, so that XXE would be tested but, for example, EXX would not."

        "a(1)=0 since no multiplication takes place. a(6)=1571 since 1571, 1100, 392, 128, 80, 48, 0 is the chain with six multiplications. In base 12, XXE, 778, 288, X8, 68, 40, 0."
