        "The known ratios of successive terms a(n)/a(n-1) are as follows. n a(n)/a(n-1) 2 120.70000... 3 121.18641... 4 101.30861... 5 102.87987... 6 101.16277... 7 100.73651... 8 100.85890... 9 100.59270... 10 100.45199... Heuristically, There appears to be a convergence. The PARI program computes the first 8 terms in a reasonable time. The 9th and 10th terms were computed by the program in the first link in 4,700 and 50,500 seconds respectively on a p4 2.53 ghz xp pro system."
