    "comment": [
        "Sequence A167153 consists of runs of numbers of the same parity. It is conjectured that each time the parity changes, there is a gap of 3 numbers, and the sequence goes on with the successor a(n)+1 (of opposite parity) of the first \"missing\" term a(n) in the run of terms of given parity (a(n-1)+1, a(n-1)+3, ..., a(n)-2)."

        "That run of odd numbers ends with a(3)-2 = 47; a(3) = 49 is missing, and the sequence goes on with even numbers starting at a(3)+1 = 50."
