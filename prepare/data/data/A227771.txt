        "Given prime factorization m = product (p_i^e_i), the antiharmonic (or contraharmonic) mean of the divisors of m is sigma_2(m)/sigma_1(m) = product (p_i^(e_i+1)+1)/(p_i+1). If this is an integer, then m is called antiharmonic.",
        "All squares are trivially antiharmonic, since (p^(2*e+1)+1)/(p+1) = p^(2*e) - p^(2*e-1) + p^(2*e-2) - ... + 1 is an integer. Sequence gives the nontrivial antiharmonic numbers.",
