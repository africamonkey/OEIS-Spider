        "The expected clique number of G(n,1/2) is the rational value a(n)/b(n), where b(n) denotes the sequence A006125 (the number of graphs on n labeled nodes). For instance, the expected clique number of G(4,1/2) is a(4)/b(4) = 151/64. G(n,1/2) denotes the random graph on n labeled nodes obtained by choosing, randomly and independently, every pair of nodes {ij} to be an edge with probability 1/2 (Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov p. 2)"
