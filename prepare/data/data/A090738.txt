        "I conjecture this sequence to be infinite. Searching through the first 200000 values, I found 7000 primes, of which over 400 were \"twins\", i.e. both n^2*(n+1)^2 and (n+2)^2*(n+3)^2 were prime, where \"*\" denotes concatenation. I conjecture there to be an infinitude of such twins and the obvious generalizations.",
        "The symmetric problem, i.e., finding two consecutive primes whose concatenation is a square, is somehow harder. Probably the smallest such primes are p = 411828016678198512725064549221 and its successor p+20, whose concatenation is equal to 641738277398347583345401533579^2. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jul 23 2015"
