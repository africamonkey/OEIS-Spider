    "comment": [
        "The name LB comes from the Stanton reference below. These are the initials of a student who mistakenly tries to find the prime factorization of 972 by finding the prime factorizations of 9 and 72 respectively and then multiplying these together. The result is incorrect but close to correct since the same primes and the same number of primes are involved.",

        "This sequence is infinite: if n is a term, then so is 10*n.",
        "The next term that is not of the form 10*n for a term already listed is 8346672.",
        "Every term is composite with at least two distinct prime factors."

        "We have 972 = 9*10^2 + 72, 972 = 2^2*3^5, 9 = 3^2, 72 = 2^3*3^2. Thus, counting multiplicity there are seven primes dividing 972, two primes dividing 9 and five primes dividing 72. Since the set of primes dividing n is {2,3}, which is the union of the sets of primes dividing 9 ({3}) and 72 ({2,3}), and 7 = 5 + 2, we have that 972 is a term in the sequence."
