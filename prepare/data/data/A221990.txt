    "comment": [
        "A permutation is squarefree if it does not contain two consecutive factors of length two or more that are in the same relative order. For example, the permutation 243156 is squarefree, while the permutation 631425 contains square 3142 (indeed, 31 is order-isomorphic to 42). A permutation is right-crucial with respect to squares if it is squarefree but any extension of it to the right by an element results in a permutation (of one larger length) that is not squarefree. For example, the permutation 2136547 is right-crucial with respect to squares. For any length larger than 6, there exist right-crucial permutations with respect to squares."
