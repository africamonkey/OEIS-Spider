    "comment": [
        "p((n,0),2) = A000712. B_n can also be thought of as the signed permutation group. B_3 acts on the alphabet {1,2,3,bar{1}, bar{2}, bar{3}}. An infant subgroup of type (2,1) will be the subgroup which stabilizes the sets {1,bar{1}, 2, bar{2}} and {3,bar{3}}."

To generate the p(alpha,2) we do the following. sum_alpha p(alpha,2)x^alpha = prod_(b in Phi) prod_(k = 1)^infinity 1/(1- x^(C(b) times k ))^2 = prod_(b in Phi) prod_(k = 1)^infinity (1+ x^(k times C(b)) + x^(2k times C(b)) + x^(3k times C(b)) + ....)^2"
