        "Since this sequence includes 0 no terms are prime. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 25 2013",
        "Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct natural numbers such that no two terms differ by a prime. - _Peter Munn_, Jun 19 2017",
        "Congruence analysis from _Peter Munn_, Jun 30 2017: (Start)",
        "If a(k) is in congruence class q mod p for some prime p, a(k) + p is the only higher number in this class that can be written as prime + a(k). Thus the ways a number m can be written as prime + a(k) for some k are much constrained if m shares membership of one or more such congruence classes with all except a few of the smaller terms in the sequence.",
        "Of the first 100 terms, congruence class 1 mod 2 (odd numbers) contains 95, 1 mod 3 contains 76, and 0 mod 5 contains 53. No other congruence class modulo a prime contains more than 23.",
        "The only even terms up to a(10000) are 0, 10, 34, 100, 310; of which 10, 100 and 310 are congruent to 10 mod 30, therefore to both 1 mod 3 and 0 mod 5. Note an initial sparseness of terms not congruent to either 1 mod 3 or 0 mod 5: this subsequence starts 9, 309, 527, 899, 989, 999. It becomes less sparse: as a proportion of the main sequence it is 0.04, 0.086 and 0.1555 of the first 100, 1000 and 10000 terms respectively.",
        "Conjecture: there are only finitely many even terms.",
