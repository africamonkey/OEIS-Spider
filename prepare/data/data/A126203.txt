        "It also follows that for any such n one of n/2, n/3, or n/30 is a perfect square. I have tested 10^5 terms of each of the recurrent sequences above and found no new perfect squares. (End)",
        "Comment from _Warut Roonguthai_, Apr 28 2007: The sequence is finite because the number of integral points on an elliptic curve is finite; in this case the curve is m^2 = 5n^3 + 30n. Multiplying the equation by 25 and letting y = 5m and x = 5n, we have y^2 = x^3 + 150x. According to MAGMA, the integral points on this curve are (x, y) = (0, 0), (10, 50), (15, 75), (24, 132), (135, 1575), (490, 10850), (600, 14700). So the list is complete.",
