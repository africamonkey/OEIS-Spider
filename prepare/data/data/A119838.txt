    "comment": [
        "In calculating this sequence, some backtracking may be needed to ensure that the sequence is unbounded. For instance, one makes the preliminary assignment a(4) = 6, since determinant[1,1,3,6] = 3, a prime greater than the previous determinant prime in A119839: 2. Then one computes a(5) = 23, giving determinant[1,3,6,23] = 5. However, the sequence hits a wall here, as any putative a(6) gives a composite determinant divisible by 3, hence we must backtrack and reassign a(4) = 8. The associated sequence of primes A119839 = 2, 5, 7, 13, 23, 149, 277, 331, 9433, ..."
