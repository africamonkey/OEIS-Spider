        "Analogous to A001359 for odd composite numbers (A071904).",
        "Consists of numbers that cannot be the difference of two primes: an odd number m can be the difference of two primes only if m+2 is prime, which cannot be the case for any a(n) as a(n)+2 is composite.",

        "Any composite of the form 6k+1 (A016921) is a term: (6k+1)+2 = 3(2k+1) is both odd and composite as a product of two odd numbers, thus 6k+1, being odd, is a term if it is composite."
