        "\"In 1965 Tibor Rado, together with Shen Lin, proved that a(3) is 21. (...) Next, in 1983, Allan Brady proved that a(4) is 107. (...) Then in 1989 Heiner Marxen and Juergen Buntrock discovered that a(5) is at least 47176870. (...) As for a(6), Marxen and Buntrock set another record in 1997 by proving that it is at least 8690333381690951.\" [Based on Aaronson's web page.]",
        "The function Sigma(n) = Sigma(n, 2) (A028444) denotes the maximal number of tape marks (1s) that a Turing Machine with n internal states (plus the Halt state,) 2 symbols, and a two-way infinite tape can write on an initially blank tape (all 0s) and then halt. The function a(n) (the present sequence) denotes the maximal number of steps S(n) = S(n, 2) (thus shifts, since direction NONE is excluded) that such a machine can make (not necessarily the same Turing machine producing a maximum number of 1s and needs not even produce many tape marks.)",

        "The sequence grows faster than any computable function of n and so is noncomputable.",
