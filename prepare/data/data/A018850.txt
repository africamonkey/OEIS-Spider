        "Nakao's table has more entries because he lists nonprimitive numbers if they are the sum of two cubes in three ways.",
        "_Rajesh Bhowmick_, Dec 12 2011: The odd number 40533595075161 can be represented as sum of two cubes in just two different ways: (34314)^(3)+(5073)^(3)=(34321)^(3)+(4730)^(3). Here the cubes are greater than 1, there is no common factor between the odd numbers, there is no common factor between the L.H.S & the R.H.S, the even number is greater than 2, the cubes are in their primitive form, and they are not of the form (27)^(3) or (121)^(3) (which are actually (3)^(9) & (11)^(6))."
