Recall that A119751 is the sequence defined recursively by a(1)=1 and a(k) is the first odd number greater than a(k-1) such that 2a(k)+1 is prime and a(k)+a(j)+1 is prime for all 1<=j<k. Let A(1)=A119751, that is, A(1,k)=A119751(k). Then A(n) is the sequence defined recursively as follows: (1) A(n,1) is the first odd number not in any A(m), 1<=m<n, such that 2A(n,1)+1 is prime. (2) A(n,k) is the first odd number greater than A(n,k-1), not in any A(m), 1<=m<n, such that 2A(n,k)+1 is prime. (3) A(n,k)+A(n,j)+1 is prime for all 1<=j<k.",
