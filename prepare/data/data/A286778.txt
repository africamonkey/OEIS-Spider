        "Let the height of the binary tree be one less than the number of rows; i.e., a complete binary tree of height 2 has one root node, its two descends and four leaf nodes. Any node u has a unique path to the root of the binary tree. Let h(u,v) be the length of the intersection of these paths for nodes u and v. Then a(n) is defined to be the sum of h(u,v) over all ordered 2-tuples of nodes in a binary tree of height n.",
