    "comment": [
        "Numbers n such that when we start scanning bits in the binary expansion of n, from the most to the least significant end, and when we interpret each bit as to a direction which to turn at each vertex (e.g., 0 = left, 1 = right) when traversing the edges of honeycomb lattice, then, when we have consumed all the bits, we have eventually returned to the same vertex where we started from and none of the other vertices have been visited twice.",
        "Indexing starts from zero, because a(0) = 0 is a special case, indicating an empty path, which certainly ends at the same vertex as where it starts from. For other cases, we always take first a right turn, because the most significant bit is always 1."
