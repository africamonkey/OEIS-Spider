        "A number n is called \"abundant\" if sigma(n) > 2n, and \"highly abundant\" if sigma(n) > sigma(m) for all m < n. With these definitions, it's possible for a number to be highly abundant but not abundant. (A similar situation occurs with 2 being prime and highly composite.)",
        "Fischer shows that all highly abundant numbers greater than 20 are multiples of 6. Since 6 is perfect and multiples of perfect numbers are abundant, this list is finite and complete."
