    "comment": [
        "A row-Fishburn matrix of size n is defined to be an upper-triangular matrix with nonnegative integer entries which sum to n and such that each row contains a nonzero entry. See A158691.",
        "Here we consider generalized row-Fishburn matrices where we allow the row_Fishburn matrices to have positive and negative nonzero entries. We define the size of a generalized row-Fishburn matrix to be the absolute sum of the matrix entries. This sequence gives the number of generalized row-Fishburn matrices of size n.",
        "Alternatively, this sequence gives the number of 2-colored row-Fishburn matrices of size n, that is, ordinary row-Fishburn matrices of size n where each nonzero entry in the matrix can have one of two different colors.",
        "More generally, if F(x) = Sum_{n >= 0} ( Product_{i = 1..n} (1 + x)^i - 1 ) is the o.g.f. for primitive row-Fishburn matrices A179525 (i.e., row-Fishburn matrices with entries restricted to the set {0,1}) and C(x) := c_1*x + c_2*x^2 + ..., where c_i is a sequence of nonnegative integers, then the composition F(C(x)) is the o.g.f. for colored row-Fishburn matrices where entry i in the matrix can have one of c_i different colors: c_i = 0 for some i means i does not appear as an entry in the Fishburn matrix. This result is an application of Lemma 2.2.22 of Goulden and Jackson."
