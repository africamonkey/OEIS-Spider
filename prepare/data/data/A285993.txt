        "The terms are in general not primitive abundant numbers (A091191), in particular this cannot be the case when a(n) is a multiple of a(n-1), as is the case for most of the terms, for which a(n) = a(n-1)*A117366(a(n-1)). In the other event, spf(a(n)) = nextprime(spf(a(n-1))), and a(n) is in A007741(2,3,4...). These are exactly the primitive terms in this sequence."
