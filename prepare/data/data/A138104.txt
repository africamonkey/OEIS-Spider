        "This is a semiprime analog of A001348 Mersenne numbers. The semiprimes in this sequence are the analogs of A000668 Mersenne primes (of form 2^p - 1 where p is a prime). a(n) is semiprime when a(n) is an element of A092561, which happens for values of n beginning 1, 3, 17, which is A085724 INTERSECTION A001358 and has no more values under 1000. Would someone like to extend the latter set of indices j of semiprimes k = A001358(j) such that (2^k)-1 is semiprime?"
