        "Since, as Euler proved, the random chance of two integers not having a common prime factor is 6/Pi^2, these are the odd integers that share common factors with an above average fraction of integers. Is it known, or can it be calculated, what portion of odd integers satisfy this condition? (All even numbers qualify; for all multiples of 2, phi(n)/n <= .5.)"
