        "A pair (x_1, x_2) has a fixed number of arrangements with it, independent of the number of zeros in the arrangement hence independent of n.",
        "For some n, we might find that (x_1, x_2) is feasible by the restrictions above. If all those 1's and 2's are signed positive, their sums become S = x_1 + 2 * x_2. We than change signs of 1's and 2's such that the sum of all terms is 0. If we change the sign of 1 from + to -, the total is reduced by 2 * 1 = 2. Similarily, if the sign of 2 from + to -, we reduce the total by 2*2 = 4. Let s_i be the number of i's we change the sign from + to -, x_i - s_i, s_i >= 0. So the sum S must be even. We get the new sum 0 = (x_1 - 2*s_1) + (2 * x_2 - 2*s_2) = x_1 + 2 * x_2 - 2 * (s_1 + s_2) = S - 2 * (s_1 + s_2). I.e. s_1 + s_2 = S/2, which is a diophantine equation. Note that the solution to this equation can be used for computation of various values of a(n). See the example for an application.",
