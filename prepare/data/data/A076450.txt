        "The 'sculpture' of a positive integer n is the infinite vector (c[1], c[2], ...), where c[k] is the number of prime factors p of n (counted with multiplicity) such that n^(1/(k+1)) < p <= n^(1/k). A number is in the sequence if its sculpture is not equal to the sculpture of any smaller number."
