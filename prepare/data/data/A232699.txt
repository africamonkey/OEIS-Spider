        "For every prime p > 2, a(n) is divisible by p for all n >= p.  It follows that, if m is odd and squarefree with largest prime factor q, then a(n) is divisible by m for all n >= q.  A similar property appears to hold for odd prime powers, in which case it would hold for all odd numbers."

The graph 1--2--3 is bipartite, but it is not point-determining (the vertices on the two ends have the same neighborhood), so it is also not counted in a(3). The only graph counted in a(3) is the graph *--*  * (with three possible labelings). - _Justin M. Troyka_, Nov 27 2013"
