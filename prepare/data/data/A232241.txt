        "This is the sequence of positive integers that can be expressed as the product of prime powers, multiplied by the sum of the same prime powers.  And the sum of the prime powers is also the greatest prime factor of the composite number.",
        "I.e., there is a solution for n=(p1^i1*p2^i2*p3^i3...)*(p1^i1+p2^i2+pi3^i3...); where p1, p2, p3, etc. are distinct primes; and i1, i2, i3, etc. are the corresponding positive exponents.",
        "The additional constraint is that the sum of the prime powers must also be the greatest prime factor (gpf) of n.",
        "This sequence also contains the square of every prime number."
