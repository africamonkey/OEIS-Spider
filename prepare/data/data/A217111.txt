        "The number of numbers with <= n places which contain all decimal digits 0..9.",
        "The ratio a(n)/10^n indicates the relative proportion of pandigital numbers <= 10^n compared to all numbers <= 10^n. Since that ratio converges to the limit 1 for n -> infinity this can be expressed for large numbers as follows (in a slightly popular manner): \u2018Almost all numbers contain all decimal digits 0..9\u2019.",
        "Example: a(n)/10^n = 0. 99973107526479... for n = 100; in this case 99.9731\u2026% of all numbers <= 10^100 contain all digits 0..9. Conversely, only the tiny proportion of 0.000268924735210... (<0.03%) lacks at least one digit. That\u2019s astonishing! Intuitively, this is not what one would expect. In fact, for smaller numbers (with which most people are faced normally) the relative portion of numbers which missing at least one digit is significantly larger. Of course, for n < 10 the portion is 100%, and even for numbers <= 10^10 or <= 10^20 the relative proportion of numbers which contain not all digits 0..9 is 99.96734...% or 78.98393...%, respectively. 10^27 is the least power of 10 such that the pandigital numbers hold the majority. Here, the proportion of pandigital numbers amongst all numbers <= 10^27 is 51.50961...%. So one could bet that a randomly chosen number <= 10^27 contains all digits.",
