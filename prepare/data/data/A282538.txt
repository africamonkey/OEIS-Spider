        "Every Pythagorean prime p can be uniquely written as the sum of two positive integers a and b such that ab is congruent to 1 (mod p).  If a>b, then the difference a-b must be an odd number; no number on this list can be said difference, and every positive odd integer NOT on this list is the difference of exactly one pair."
