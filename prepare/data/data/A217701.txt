    "comment": [
        "a(n) is the number of terms that appear before cancellations occur in the evaluation of the determinant of an n X n matrix by the usual sum over permutations of [n], for a matrix whose off diagonal entries are specified, and each of whose diagonal entries is minus the sum of the negatives of the off diagonal entries and one additional term, as in the usual presentation of the matrix in the Matrix Tree Theorem.",
        "The number a(n-1) - n^(n-2) (A000272) is the number of terms which cancel in Zeilberger's proof of the Matrix Tree Theorem. This number is even, as the terms which cancel are equal in magnitude with opposite sign, and as is also apparent from the formula in terms of A087981(n) which is a corollary of Zeilberger's proof.",
        "Formula involves the derangement numbers A000166 which count permutations with no fixed points, also the number A087981 of colored permutations with no fixed points of n elements where each cycle is one of two colors."
