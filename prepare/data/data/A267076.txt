        "_Sergei Chernykh_ has conducted several searches for amicable pairs in the 18-digit range (here p and q are the largest prime factors):",
        "1) All pairs of the form (m*p^k1, n*q^k2) where k1 > 1 _OR_ k2 > 1",
        "2) All pairs of the form (m*p, n*q) where m < 2*10^11 _AND_ n < 2*10^11",
        "3) Current exhaustive search has already found all pairs of the form (m*p^k1, n*q^k2) where p < 21818622 for any k1, q, k2",
        "If we combine the results of these searches it is easy to see that the remaining undiscovered pairs can only have the form (m*p, n*q) where their largest prime factors are p > 21818622 and q < 10000000 (2*10^18 / 2*10^11), so they can't have the same sopfr.",
        "This means that all 18-digit members of A267076 are already known. There are no new ones. (End)",
