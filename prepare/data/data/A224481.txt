        "y = x^2 - 34 is one of a family of quadratics y = x^2 + c that produces averages of twin prime pairs.  The first 24 negative c that produce averages are equivalent to either 0 or 2 (mod 6) (as calculated by maxima); and they differ by no more than 6.  Other than that, I have not found an order to the sequence of negative c.  The first 11 positive c that produce averages are apparently the beginning of",
