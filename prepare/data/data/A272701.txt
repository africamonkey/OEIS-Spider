        "Motivation was that question: What are the numbers that are the sums of 2 positive cubes in more than 1 way and also sums of 2 positive squares in more than 1 way?",
        "A001235(99) = 4624776 = 2^3*3^6*13*61 is the least number with this property.",
        "A taxi-cab number (A001235) can be the sum of two nonzero squares in exactly one way. For example 22754277 is the least taxi-cab number that is the sum of two nonzero squares in exactly one way. 22754277 = 69^3 + 282^3 = 189^3 + 252^3 = 2646^2 + 3969^2. So 22754277 is not a member of this sequence. The next one is 8*22754277 = 182034216 = 138^3 + 564^3 = 378^3 + 504^3 = 2646^2 + 13230^2.",
        "A taxi-cab number (A001235) can be of the form 2*n^2. For example 760032072 is the least number with this property. 760032072 = 114^3 + 912^3 = 513^3 + 855^3 = 2*19494^2. Note that 760032072 is a term of A081324. So it is not a term of this sequence.",
        "216226981 = 373*661*877 is the first term that has three prime divisors. It is also first squarefree term in this sequence.",
        "It is easy to see that this sequence is infinite."
