    "example": [
        "Since the exponents in 1680's prime factorization are (4,1,1,1), the k-th power of 1680 has (4k+1)(k+1)^3 = 4k^4 + 13k^3 + 15k^2 + 7k + 1 divisors. Comparison with the analogous formulas for all smaller members of A025487 shows the following:",
        "a) No number smaller than 1680 has a positive coefficient in its \"power formula\" for any exponent larger than k^4.",
        "b) The only power formula with a k^4 coefficient as high as 4 is that for 1260 (4k^4 + 12k^3 + 13k^2 + 6k + 1).",
        "c) The k^3 coefficient for 1680 is higher than for 1260.",
