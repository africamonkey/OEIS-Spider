        "The first positive member of this sequence and some of its multiples are related to the exceptional Lie group E_8 calculation. The result of the calculation is a matrix with 453060 rows and columns. The size of the matrix is a(1)=453060 and the number of entries of the matrix is a(453060)=453060*453060=205263363600."
