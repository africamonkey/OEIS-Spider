        "The marathon distance was only standardized to 42195 meters in 1924; before then, distances varied from about 40000 to 40750. This sequence does not include hurdles, steeplechase, relays, medleys, team races, walks, or cross country. It also excludes the 60 meter of the 1900 and 1904 Olympics and the women's 3000 meter in 1984, 1988, and 1992; additionally, the women's running events did not include all of these distances until 1996. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 06 2016"
