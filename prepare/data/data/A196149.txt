        "The polymath8 project led by Terry Tao refers to these numbers as \"3-densely divisible\". In general they say that n is y-densely divisible if its divisors increase by a factor of y or less, or equivalently, if for every R with 1 <= R <= n, there is a divisor in the interval [R/y,R]. They use this as a weakening of the condition that n be y-smooth. - _David S. Metzler_, Jul 02 2013"
