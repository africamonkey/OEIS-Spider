        "The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [RED ; BLUE ; NEUTRAL] or [NEUTRAL ; RED ; BLUE], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the sequence is optimal (the sequence presented gives the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle for the given pre-coloring configurations). Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",
