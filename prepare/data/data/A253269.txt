    "comment": [
        "Each pair of twins here form a size-two connected component in the graph considered in A158576.",
        "A naive heuristic argument based on the density of primes claims that this sequence should be infinite, and in fact that a positive proportion of all primes should have this property.  A prime p has 9*log_10(p) neighbors, each prime with \"probability\" 1/log(p), and with all the other 2*9*log_10(p) neighbors being composite with \"probability\" (1-1/log(p))^(2*9*log_10(p)). For a large prime p, this goes to the limit 9/(exp(18/log(10))*log(10)), or about 0.16%.  The fact that base-10 primes need to end with digit 1/3/7/9 will change the value of this probability, but won't change the fact that it is nonzero.",
