    "comment": [
        "Using empirical data for 1 <= n <= 10000, it has been found that the distribution of these terms correlates well (R^2 = 0.9798) to g(n) = b*n^(1/2) with 'b' a constant approximately 0.70. In addition, g'(n) approximates the probability that any particular n has this property. Any terms in sequence A056154 must also satisfy this sequence."
