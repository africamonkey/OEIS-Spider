    "comment": [
        "By \"reversal\" of n's representation in binary, it is meant: write n in binary (without its leading 0's) from most significant digits on the right and least significant digits on the left, instead of writing n from left to right as is usual. Then interpret the new integer by reading it from left to right.",

        "29 in binary is 11101. Its digital reversal is 10111, which is 23 in decimal. Since 29 > 23, then 29 is in this sequence."
