    "name": "Let B be a nonempty and proper subset of A_n = {1,2,...,p_n-1}, where p_n is the n-th prime. Let C be the complement of B, so that the union B and C is A_n. a(n) is half the number of sums of products of elements of B and elements of C, when B runs through all such subsets of A_n.",
    "example": [
        "Take A_3 ={1,2,3,4}.  The nonempty and proper subsets are: {{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,4}, {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}}.",
        "Sums of products of elements of B and elements of C are: 1+2*3*4=25, and analogously 14,11,10,14,11,10,10,11,14,10,11,14,25.",
        "We have 6 numbers divisible by 5. So a(3)=6/2=3."
