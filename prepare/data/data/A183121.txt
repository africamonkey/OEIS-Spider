        "A.   The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [RED ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL] or [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; BLUE], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the presented sequence is NOT optimal. The particular \"64\" algorithm solving the puzzle at hand is not explicitly presented in any of the referenced papers. The series and its properties are listed in the paper referenced by link 2 listed below. For the optimal solution of the Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the given pre-coloring configuration see A183115 and A183116. Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",
