        "This function was derived as an expansion of : n/Log(n],n/(log[n]-1) in terms of n ( PrimePi[n] like) . I noticed thast it was giving ionization potential like output and adjusted it to give those values where the function was better than average. It corresponded to stable nuclear atomic numbers. It predicts a stability plateau around atomic number 146."
