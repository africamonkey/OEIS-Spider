        "This is in some sense the nontrivial part of A160350: Indeed, Kaplan (2007) has shown that Phi[pqr] has coefficients in {0,1,-1} if r = +-1 (mod pq), where p<q<r are primes. Here we list the odd elements of A160350 (i.e. of A117223) which do not satisfy this equality (i.e. which are not in A160353).",
