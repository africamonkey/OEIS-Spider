        "Perfect squares are assumed to have a continued fraction expansion of all zeros after a(0) and so are trivially multiplicative",
        "For nonsquares, a(1) must be 1 and so n must satisfy k+1/2 < sqrt(n) <= k+1, for some integer k."

        "The continued fraction of sqrt(22) is (4; 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 8, ...), which is multiplicative with a(2^e) = 2, a(3^e) = 4, a(p^e) = 1 otherwise."
