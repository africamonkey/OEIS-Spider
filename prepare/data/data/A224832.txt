        "This sequence is a subsequence of A194771. The sequence A139256 (twice even perfect numbers) is a subsequence and the sum of the reciprocals of even divisors equals 1 (see the proof in this sequence). But, for the non-twice even perfect numbers of this sequence, for example a(5) = 60480, a(6) = 65520, a(7) = 4357080 so the sum of the reciprocals of even divisors equals 2.",
