    "comment": [
        "In a 'spatula flip', a spatula is inserted below any pancake and all pancakes above the spatula are lifted and replaced in reverse order.",
        "It is conjectured that the initial configuration in which the pancakes are in the correct order but all of the burnt sides are up is a worst case for the problem. If so, then this sequence is identical to A078942."
