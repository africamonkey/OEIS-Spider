        "Define a segmented partition a(n, k, <s(1)..s(j)>) to be a partition of n with exactly k parts, with s(j) parts t(j) identical to each other and distinct from all other parts. Note that n>=k, j<=k, 0<=s(j)<=k, s(1)t(1) + ... + s(j)t(j) = n and s(1) + ... + s(j) = k.",
        "A partition of 2n has segment structure symmetry if there is at least one way it can be arranged into two consecutive sequences (no central summand), with each sequence exhibiting the same segment structure.",
        "If the total number of parts is an odd number, then a partition of 2n cannot exhibit segment structure symmetry.",
        "Every partition of n into exactly 2 parts has structure symmetry <1><1>.",
