        "There are two four-digit terms in the sequence. Further terms are obtained (a) by inserting at the center of these terms any number of 9's and (b) by concatenating a term any number of times with itself and inserting an equal number of 0's at all junctures. Method (b) may be applied recursively to all terms. - Revised thanks to a comment from _Hans Havermann_, Jan 27 2004.",

Random tests for larger n (up to 50 digits) have shown that periods 1 and 2 are very frequent (> 90 %), period 14 is not unusual (7 to 8 %), periods 22, 12 and 17 are very rare and other periods did not appear.",
