        "Two generating sets are considered to be the same if they differ only by some relabeling of the points, i.e., conjugating by some element of S_n. For instance, the generating set {(1,2), (1,2,3,4)} is the same as {(2,3),(1,2,3,4)} by the relabeling 1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->1. As a non-example, the generating sets {(1,2),(1,2,3,4,5)} and {(1,3),(1,2,3,4,5)} are different, since the points in the transpositions are differently placed in the 5-cycle."
