        "Wire is marked into n equal segments by n-1 marks, is bent at right angles at each of these points, making each segment parallel to one of two rectangular axes. (Stays in plane, bends are of +-90 degs.) May cross itself but is not self-coincident over a finite length. Two configurations which differ only in a rotation or turning over are not counted as different."
