        "d(15) = 4, and d(15+1) = 5. Any positive integers m+1 with exactly 5 divisors must by of the form p^4, where p is prime. So m = p^4 -1 = (p^2+1)*(p+1)*(p-1). Now, in order for d(m) to have exactly 4 divisors, m must either be of the form q^3 or q*r, where q and r are distinct primes. But no p is such that (p^2+1)*(p+1)*(p-1) = q^3. And the only p where (p^2+1)*(p+1)*(p-1) = q*r is when p = 2 ( and so q=5, r =3). So there is only one m where both d(m) = 4 and d(m+1) = 5, which is when m=15. Therefore 15 is in this sequence."
