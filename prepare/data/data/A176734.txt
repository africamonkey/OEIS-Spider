        "a(n) enumerates the possibilities for distributing n beads, n>=1, labeled differently from 1 to n, over a set of (unordered) necklaces, excluding necklaces with exactly one bead, and k=8 indistinguishable, ordered, fixed cords, each allowed to have any number of beads. Beadless necklaces as well as beadless cords contribute a factor 1 in the counting, e.g., a(0):= 1*1 =1. See A000255 for the description of a fixed cord with beads. This produces for a(n) the exponential (aka binomial) convolution of the subfactorial sequence {A000166(n)} and the sequence {A049388(n) = (n+7)!/7!}. See the necklaces and cords problem comment in A000153. Therefore the recurrence with inputs holds. This comment derives from a family of recurrences found by Malin Sjodahl for a combinatorial problem for certain quark and gluon diagrams (Feb 27 2010)."

For n=4 one considers the following weak 2 part compositions of 4: (4,0), (3,1), (2,2), and (0,4), where (1,3) does not appear because there are no necklaces with 1 bead. These compositions contribute respectively !4*1,binomial(4,3)*!3*c8(1), (binomial(4,2)*!2)*c8(2), and 1*c8(4) with the subfactorials !n:=A000166(n) (see the necklace comment there) and the c8(n):=A049388(n) numbers for the pure 8-cord problem (see the remark on the e.g.f. for the k cords problem in A000153; here for k=8: 1/(1-x)^8).
