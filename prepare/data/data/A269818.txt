        "This sequence is characterized by the following property (theorem).",
        "Theorem. If n is coprime to the number of its even divisors, then n is 1 or of the form 2m^2, m>0.",
        "Proof. If n is odd, its number of even divisors is 0 and since gcd(n,0)=|n| (for any n), n must be 1 to be coprime to 0. If n is even, then it is of the form 2^k*p^a*q*^b*...*r^c, where p, q, r are odd primes and k, a, b, c are positive integers, and its sum of even divisors is k*(1+a)*(1+b)*...*(1+c). The latter number can be coprime to an even number only if it is odd, implying that k must be odd and a, b, ..., c must be even; thus n is twice a square."
