        "The max_d and min_d operations work as follows.  Consider max_d(x) for x=723810; we read x from left to right, digit by digit.  We replace the 7 by the biggest of the 7 digits on its right (including itself), which is 8, producing 823810.  We replace the 2 by the biggest of the 2 digits on its right (including itself), so 2 is replaced by 3, producing 833810.  Applying the same rule to the third-digit 3 gives 838810; to the 8 gives 838810 (no change); the 1 is replaced by itself, again giving 838810; and then the 0 is replaced by the largest of the 0 digits to its right (including itself), but since there are none the 0 is replaced by nothing, giving 83881.  Therefore max_d(723810) = 83881.  min_d(x) works in similar fashion, but replacing each digit by the smallest digit to its right including itself.",
        "The sequence consists of those x such that x = (min_d(x)+max_d(x))/2, such as 1519, where 1519 = (1119+1919)/2=3038/2=1519."
