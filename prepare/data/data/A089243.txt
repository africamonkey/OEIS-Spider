        "Two arrangements are considered the same if one is a rotation or reflection of the other.",
        "A \"stroke\" is defined as follows. If the following conditions are satisfied then the partition to directed paths on a directed graph is called \"a partition to strokes on a directed graph\". And all directed paths in the partition are called \"strokes\". C.1. Two different directed paths in a partition do not have the same edges. C.2. A union of two different paths in a partition does not become a directed path. In other word, a \"stroke\" is a locally maximal path on a directed graph.",
        "This sequence has its origin in the strokes made when writing Japanese Kanji."
