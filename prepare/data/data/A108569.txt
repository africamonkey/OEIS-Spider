        "If n is an even term of this sequence then 2n is also in the sequence. This is because phi(2n) = 2*phi(n) = 2*phi(n+phi(n)) = phi(2n+ 2*phi(n)) = phi(2n+phi(2n)). If n is an even term of this sequence then for each natural number m, 2^m*n is in the sequence. For example, since 4 is in the sequence 2^n for each n, n>1 is in the sequence. If p is a Sophie Germain prime greater than 3 then n = 2*p*(2p+1) is in the sequence because phi(n+phi(n)) = phi(2*p*(2p+1)+2*p*(p-1)) = phi(6p^2) = 2*p*(p-1) = phi(n). Conjecture: Except for the first term all terms are even.",
        "If n is in the sequence and the natural number m divides gcd(phi(n),n) then for all nonnegative integers k, m^k*n are in the sequence. For example 110 is in the sequence and 10 divides gcd(phi(110),110), so 11*10^k for all natural numbers k are in the sequence. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Dec 12 2005"
