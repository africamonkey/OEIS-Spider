        "To compute the terms in order, start with a list with the element 0.  Add 1^2 to each term of the list and add the sum to the list, if it isn't already on the list.  The cardinality of the list is a(1).  Then a(n+1) is computed by adding n^2 to each member of the list and adding the sum to the list, if it isn't already there.  The number of members of the list is a(2).  This is much faster than considering every subset. _Jud McCranie_, Mar 01 2012"
