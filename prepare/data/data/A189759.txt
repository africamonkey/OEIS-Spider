        "The number pq+pr+qr is prime only if p, q, and r are distinct. The primes of form pq+pr+qr are in A087054. A prime may have multiple representations as pq+pr+qr; for example, 2*3*13 and 3*5*7 both produce the prime 71.",
        "As mentioned by Ufnarovski and Ahlander, if pq+pr+qr is prime, then the arithmetic derivative (A003415) of pqr is that prime. They conjecture that this sequence and A087054 are infinite."
