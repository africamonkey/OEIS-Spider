        "The list of the divisors of a(6)=24, {1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24}, lexicographically precedes the list for the previous term in the sequence (in this case, {1,2,3,4,6,12}, the list for a(5)=12). Therefore 24 belongs in the sequence. 36 does not satisfy this requirement, as {1,2,3,4,6,9 . . .} comes after {1,2,3,4,6,8 . . .} in lexicographic order. Since 8^k/9^k increases without limit as k decreases, sigma(36)_k < sigma(24)_k for almost all negative values of k; therefore 36 does not belong in the sequence."
