        "The a(n) represent the number of n-move routes of a fairy chess piece starting in the central square (m = 5) on a 3 X 3 chessboard. This fairy chess piece behaves like a king on the eight side and corner squares but on the central square the king goes crazy and turns into a red king, see A179596.",
        "The sequence above corresponds to just one red king vector, i.e. A[5] vector, with decimal [binary] value 325 [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1]. This vectors leads for the corner squares to A083424 and for the side squares to A003947.",
