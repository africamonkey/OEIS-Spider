    "name": "A total of n married couples, including a mathematician M and his wife W, are to be seated at the 2n chairs around a circular table. M and W are the first couple allowed to choose chairs, and they choose two chairs next to each other. The sequence gives the number of ways of seating the remaining couples so that women and men are in alternate chairs but M and W are the only couple seated next to each other.",
    "comment": [
        "After M and W are seated at neighboring chairs, the problem of enumerating the ways of seating the remaining n-1 married couples is equivalent to the following problem: find the number of ways of seating n-1 married couples at 2*(n-1) chairs in a straight line, men and women in alternate chairs, so that no husband is next to his wife. According to our comment in A000271, this problem has a solution 2*(n-1)!*A000271(n-1), n>=2. Here the coefficient 2 should be replaced by 1, since the place of the first woman W, by the condition, is already fixed."
