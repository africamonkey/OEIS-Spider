If p_n is a member, then its index n is also a member. Thus the sequence is completely determined by its odd nonprime terms: 1, 9, 15, 25, ..., (A249730) and is obtained as a union of their multiples with powers of 2, and all prime recurrences that start with those values: A007097 U A057450 U A057451 U A057452 U A057453 U ..., etc."
