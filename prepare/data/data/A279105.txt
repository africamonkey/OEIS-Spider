    "comment": [
        "A number k with two parts in its symmetric representation of sigma(k) [ssrs(k) = 2] has the form k = q*p with q in A174973, p prime and 2*q < p. This implies that 2*q <= row(k) < p and the first 0 in the k-th row of A249223 (having row(k) = floor((sqrt(8*k+1)-1)/2) entries) occurs at position 2*q so that 2*q-1 is the number of legs in each of the two parts. Therefore, the numbers 2*q-1 with q in A174973 are the only possible leg counts when ssrs(k) = 2, and for given q in A174973 and smallest prime p(q) > 2*q the number k = q*p(q) is the smallest with a leg count of 2*q-1. Consequently, each number q*p in the column of the irregular triangle A239929 labeled by q in A174793 with p prime satisfies ssrs(q*p) = 2*q-1.",
