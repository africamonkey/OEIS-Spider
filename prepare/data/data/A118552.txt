        "The PARI program can compute the first 9 terms in reasonable time. a(10) was computed by the program in the link. This took 145 sec on a p4 2.53 ghz while a(13) took 1.4 days and a(14) took 15 days with multitasking. The sum of twin primes < 10^n divided by 4 gives a very good approximation for the number of twin primes < 10^(2n). Eg., Sum of twin primes <= 10^8 divided by 4 = 10301443659233. Pi_2(10^16) = 10304185697298. This is an error of .00002661."
