        "Given only the last 5 (say) digits of a large integer N, can you determine whether N is not some power of 2? This is equivalent to ask which 5-digit numbers are of the form 2^j (mod 10^6) where j is any positive integer. So if the last 5 digits of N are not in this sequence, then N is not a power of 2.",
        "If we have only the last k digits of an integer N, we can determine whether N is not a power of 2, if and only if the number given by those digits is divisible by 5 OR not a multiple of 2^k. - Francisco Salinas (franciscodesalinas(AT)hotmail.com), Aug 27 2004. [Edited for clarification and simplification by _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 06 2017, following discussions with _David A. Corneth_, _Peter Munn_ and _N. J. A. Sloane_. The given condition says when a k-digit number is not in this sequence. In that case we know that N is not a power of 2, otherwise, we cannot know.]"
