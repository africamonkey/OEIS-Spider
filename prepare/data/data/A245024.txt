        "The first comment is wrong as stated. This would fix it: for every pair of primes (p,q), p>q>=3, if a(n)==1 (mod p) then a(n) not==3 (mod q). Divisibility by 3 means 6m+4 is in the sequence for all m>0, and 6m never is, while 6m+2 is undetermined. Divisibility by 5 means 30m+26 is always in the sequence, and 30m+8 never is. This proves the above conjecture. - _Jens Kruse Andersen_, Jul 13 2014",
