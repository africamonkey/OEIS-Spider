        "A rational number is created by 1/n + 1/n^2 + 1/(n+1) + 1/(n+1)^2 and has a reduced numerator of 2*n^3 + 5*n^2 + 3*n + 1.",
        "From n=1 to 100, 38 primes, 48 semiprimes, and 14 numbers requiring three or more prime factors were created.  This is very anomalous compared to the expected distribution of such numbers from 1 to 2050301."
