        "The first 2500 entries, perhaps more, are the same as those of A051110. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 18 2008",
        "In fact, this is a duplicate of A051110. It is evident that all terms p in this sequence are in A051110, since p+d is composite for d in D = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}, and so with the least prime q dividing p+d, q <= (p+d)/q <= (p+d)/2 <= (p+12)/2 < p for p > 12 (smaller primes can easily be checked), so q divides (p-1)!. Hence it suffices to show that all p in A051110 are in this sequence. If not, then p+d is prime but p+d divides (p-1)!, a contradiction. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 05 2017"
