        "Let S be an odd positive number. The S-sequence of positive numbers is defined to be the sequence {prod_{i=1,...,r} q_(n+t_i)}_{n>=1}, where {q_i} is sequence A050376 and sum_{i=1,...,r} 2^t_i is the binary representation of S, such that t_1>t_2>...>t_r=0. Note that {S_1, S_3, S_5, ...} is a partition of all integers > 1. Then S_1=A050376, which is obtained when we set r=1,t_1=0.",
