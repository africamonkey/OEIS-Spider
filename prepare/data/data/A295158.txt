        "This sequence is finite and complete. See the von Eitzen Link. For positive integer n, if n > 7845 then the number of ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares is at least 11. So for n > 7845, there are more than nine ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares. For n <= 7845, it has been verified if n is in the sequence by inspection. Hence the sequence is complete."
