        "The only repeated terms are 1!, 2!, 3!, etc. Deleting one of each leaves A092824. When written as an array with (row n)=n!*(Farey fractions of order n), The row sums are given by A093593. The n-th alternating row sum is n!/2, for n>=2. (2/n!)*(n-th row sum)=A005728(n)=number of Farey fractions of order n."
