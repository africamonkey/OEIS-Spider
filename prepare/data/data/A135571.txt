        "Conjecture. This sequence is just the sequence of positive integers that are either square, twice a square, or triangular, but not both square and triangular (A001110). (This has been verified for n up to 100000.)",
        "If the triangular number 0 is allowed, then Verhoeff has shown (see the reference) that the numbers that are the difference of two triangular numbers in exactly one way are just the powers of 2."
