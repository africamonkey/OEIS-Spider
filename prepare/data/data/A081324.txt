        "If n = a^2 + b^2, where a and b are nonzero integers, then n^3 = (a^2 + b^2)^3 = A^2 + B^2 = C^2 + D^2 where;",
        "A = 2*a^2*b + (a^2-b^2)*b = 3*a^2*b - b^3,",
        "B = 2*a*b^2 - (a^2-b^2)*a = 3*a*b^2 - a^3,",
        "C = 2*a*b^2 + (a^2-b^2)*a = 1*a*b^2 + a^3,",
        "D = 2*a^2*b - (a^2-b^2)*b = 1*a^2*b + b^3.",
        "Obviously, A, B, C, D are always nonzero because a and b are nonzero integers. Additionally, if a^2 is not equal to b^2, then (A, B) and (C, D) are distinct pairs, that is, n^3 can be expressible as a sum of two nonzero squares more than one way. Since we know that n is a sum of two nonzero squares if and only if n^3 is a sum of two nonzero squares (see comment section of A000404); if n^3 is the sum of two nonzero squares in exactly one way, n must be a^2 + b^2 with a^2 = b^2 and n is the sum of two nonzero squares in exactly one way. That is the definition of this sequence, so this sequence is exactly A050804 except \"0\" that is the first term of this sequence. (End) [Edited by _Altug Alkan_, May 14 2016]",
