        "Theorem (I. N. Ianakiev): There are infinitely many such numbers. Proof: Any A001110(2n+1), for n>0, is such a number as A001110(2n+1) = (2a+1)^2+(4a^2+4a)(4a^2+4a+1)(1/2), where a = (A002315(n)-1)(1/2). Note: other numbers, not of the form A001110(2n+1), e.g. A001110(6), are also in the sequence (see the example below).",
