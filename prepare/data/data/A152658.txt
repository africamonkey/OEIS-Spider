        "A sequence of consecutive primes prime(k), ..., prime(k+r), r >= 1, is called a chain of primes if i*prime(i) + (i+1)*prime(i+1) is prime (the linking prime for prime(i) and prime(i+1), cf. A119487) for i from k to k+r-1. A chain of primes prime(k), ..., prime(k+r) is maximal if it is not part of a longer chain, i.e. if neither (k-1)*prime(k-1) + k*prime(k) nor (k+r)*prime(k+r) + (k+r+1)*prime(k+r+1) is prime.",
