        "The number of different binary strings of length 2n that can be constructed with an equal number (n) of 0's and 1's, based on a given partition of the 0's (or 1's) into uninterrupted runs, can be written as Nseq(n,partition)=(n+1)!/(Prod_j(m_j!)(n-m+1)!) where:",

        "Prod_j(m_j!)(n-m+1)! becomes n! at the extremes (finest partition of n, m=n -- coarsest partition of n, m=1). Nseq (n,partition) is in that sense a relative measure of the complexity of the partition and the associated binary strings. a(n) is the number of strings obtained based on the partition of n that maximizes Nseq(n,partition)."
