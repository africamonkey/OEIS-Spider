    "name": "Each subsequent term in the series describes the digits of the previous term, by tallying their cumulative total within the term. This is similar to the \"look and say\" sequence, but deviates from it in that blocks of like digits are described individually, according to position.",
    "comment": [
        "More terms can be represented beyond those listed, but only with symbols to quantify integers greater than ten. Each term contains a replicate of the previous term; the length of each term is twice that of the previous term (The last term in the series does not adhere to this rule because its omitted parts contain nonintegers.)."

    "example": [
        "Read aloud the running count of each distinct digit within each term, followed by the digit thus described, to determine each subsequent term, i. e., A(1)=1 produces \"first one,\" or \"11,\" thus A(2)=11; A(2)=11 produces \"first one, second one,\" or \"1121,\" thus A(3)=1121; A(3)=1121 produces \"first one, second one, first two, third one,\" or \"11211231,\" thus A(4)=11211231; A(4)=11211231 produces \"first one, second one, first two, third one, fourth one, second two, first three, fifth one,\" or \"1121123141221351,\" thus A(5)=1121123141221351."
