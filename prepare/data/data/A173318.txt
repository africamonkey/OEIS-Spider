        "Partial sums of number of runs in binary expansion of n (n>0). Partial sums of number of 1's in Gray code for n. The subsequence of squares in this partial sum begins 0, 1, 4, 9, 144, 169, 256, 289, 324 (since we also have 32 and 128 I wonder about why so many powers). The subsequence of primes in this partial sum begins: 3, 11, 17, 29, 31, 37, 41, 53, 79, 89, 101, 137, 149, 181, 191, 197, 229, 271.",
