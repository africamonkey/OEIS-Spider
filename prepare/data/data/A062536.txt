        "A family of nonsquare values for a(n) may be generated by the formula a(n) = n{(n + 2)^2 + 1 }/2 for n not a multiple of 5. For some values of a(n) which are squares, the three kissing circles share a common external tangent and their radii are related by 1/sqrt(x) = 1/sqrt(y) + 1/sqrt(z)."
