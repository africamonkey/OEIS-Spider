    "comment": [
        "All n_nacci sequences whose first n-1 terms are zeros followed by 1 are complete sequences. As n increases, the terms n+1,...,2n are 1,2,..,2^n (ascending powers of 2). In the limit as n tends to infinity the n_nacci sequence after an initial infinite set of zeros followed by 1 has successive terms of increasing powers of 2. This limiting sequence is the most minimal complete sequence. Consequently for each n_nacci(p) sequence there must be a largest p where n_nacci(p) >= 2^(p-n-1)."
