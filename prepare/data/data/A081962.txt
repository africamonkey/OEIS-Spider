        "If m and n are the generators of the primitive Pythagorean triples (PPT) with m>n, GCD(m,n)=1 and (m+n) odd then the odd leg is m^2-n^2 and the even leg is 2m*n. Therefore the even leg is shortest if 2m*n<m^2-n^2, i.e., m>(1+sqrt(2))*n. Also this is a sequence of numbers whose square is the semiperimeter of a PPT. - _Frank M Jackson_, Oct 10 2014"
