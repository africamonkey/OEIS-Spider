    "comment": [
        "The rationale for the starting point are twofold: 1) A number which is itself non-pandigital could be considered in some sense as having infinitely many digits in its segment for the purposes of the record here (if the sole missing digit were not 0) and 2) After 168 a value giving a 'record' segment length under 51 would seem peculiar.  A217609 gives the length of the shortest padigital right segment of 2^A217608 (not the longest non-pandigital one)."
