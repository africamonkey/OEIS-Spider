        "Lim a(n)/a(n-1) as n->inf. = 4.61158178931... = e^(arccosh(1+sqrt2)). This constant is found in the Descartes circle formula given (\"curvature\" = 1/r), which states that given 4 mutually tangent circles with curvatures a,b,c,d, (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) = 1/2(a + b + c + d)^2. Let a=b=1. Find the radius of circle c such that the radius of the innermost circle d = 1/(r of c). The answer is r of c = 4.611581789... and r of d = 1/4.611581... = 0.216845335437. Let C = 4.611581... C + 1/C = 2 + sqrt(8), where C may be found through an iterative method: 1. Begin with the formula for the radius r of the innermost tangential circle surrounded by 3 mutually tangent circles with radii a, b, c. Given a = b = 1, with c variable, then r = f(c) = (2*sqrt(1 + 2/c) - 2 - 1/c) / (4/c - 1/c^2). 2. Using an iterative operation, take any real number 1 or >1. (we can use 1). Find f(c) then repeatedly use 1/f(c) as the new c. After about a dozen of such operations, the fixed constant becomes 4.61158178931... This constant C has the property that C + 1/C = 4.828427124... = 2 + sqrt(8)."
