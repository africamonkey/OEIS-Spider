    "comment": [
        "A straight-line program (SLP) is a sequence that starts at 1 and has each entry obtained from two preceding entries by addition, multiplication, or subtraction. The length of the SLP is defined as that of the sequence without the first 1. An SLP is said to be reduced if there is no repetition in the sequence. Two SLPs are considered equivalent if their sequences define the same subset(only difference is sequence order).  This sequence gives the number of SLPs with n steps in which 0 does not appear.",
        "This sequence can also be thought of as defining the size of the search space that needs to be traversed when trying to compute other SLP related OEIS sequences such as A216999 or A229686. This is because 0 is never needed in the shortest SLP calculation of any other integer.",
