        "Except for the initial entry 1, the entries of the sequence are the Heinz numbers of all partitions that contain all parts 1,2,...,k, where k is the largest part. The Heinz number of a partition p = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_r] is defined as Product(p_j-th prime, j=1...r) (concept used by Alois P. Heinz in A215366 as an \"encoding\" of a partition). For example, for the partition [1,1,2,4,10] the Heinz number is 2*2*3*7*29 = 2436. The number 150 (= 2*3*5*5) is in the sequence because it is the Heinz number of the partition [1,2,3,3]. - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 22 2015",
