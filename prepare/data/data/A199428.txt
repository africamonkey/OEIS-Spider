        "Primes that become composite if any digit is removed, changed, or inserted anywhere. First & smallest  term found by Jens K. Andersen in 2008; five more by Giovanni Resta in Nov. 2011. Expected infinite of them. These primes emerge in relation to the prime-version of classical Doublets puzzle by Lewis Carrol. Correspond to the \"aloof\" words as named by Donald Knuth."
