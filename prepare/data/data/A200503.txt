        "Prime sextuplets (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12, p+16) are densest permissible constellations of 6 primes. Average gaps between sextuplets (and, more generally, between prime k-tuples) can be deduced from the Hardy-Littlewood k-tuple conjecture and are O(log^6(p)). Maximal gaps may be significantly larger than average gaps; this sequence suggests that maximal gaps are O(log^7(p)).",

        "(1) Conjectured upper bound: gaps between prime sextuplets (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12, p+16) are smaller than 0.058*(log p)^7, where p is the prime at the end of the gap.",
        "(2) Estimate for the actual size of the maximal gap that ends at p: maximal gap = a(log(p/a)-1/3), where a = 0.058*(log p)^6 is the average gap between sextuplets near p, as predicted by the Hardy-Littlewood k-tuple conjecture.",
        "Formulas (1) and (2) are asymptotically equal as p tends to infinity. However, (1) yields values greater than all known gaps, while (2) yields \"good guesses\" that may be either above or below the actual size of maximal gaps. Both formulas (1) and (2) are derived from the Hardy-Littlewood k-tuple conjecture via probability-based heuristics relating the expected maximal gap size to the average gap. Neither of the formulas has a rigorous proof (the k-tuple conjecture itself has no formal proof either). In both formulas, the constant ~0.058 is reciprocal to the Hardy-Littlewood 6-tuple constant 17.2986..."
