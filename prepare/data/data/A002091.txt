    "comment": [
        "A stronger version of the second Goldbach conjecture (every odd number can be expressed as the sum of 3 primes) states that every odd number n > 5 can be written as n = 2*p + q, p, q prime. The conjecture was posed by E. Lemoine and later by H. Levy. The article by B.H. Mayoh assumes q {1,prime}. For the representations of n minimizing q, the sequence gives the value of n at which a larger q than for all representations of j<n is required. The new record value of q is given in A002092. The corresponding sequences for q prime and q=1 excluded are A194828 and A194829. - Hugo Pfoertner, Sep 03 2011",
