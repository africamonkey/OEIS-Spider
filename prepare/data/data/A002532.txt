        "The same sequence may be obtained by the following process. Starting a priori with the fraction 1/1, the numerators of fractions built according to the rule: add top and bottom to get the new bottom, add top and 6 times the bottom to get the new top. The limit of the sequence of fractions is sqrt(6). - _Cino Hilliard_, Sep 25 2005",
        "For n>=2, number of ordered partitions of n-1 into parts of sizes 1 and 2 where there are two types of 1 (singletons) and five types of 2 (twins). For example, the number of possible configurations of families of n-1 male (M) and female (F) offspring considering only single births and twins, where the birth order of M/F/pair-of-twins is considered and there are five types of twins; namely, both F (identical twins), both F (fraternal twins), both M (identical), both M (fraternal), or one F and one M - where birth order within a pair of twins itself is disregarded. In particular, for a(3)=9, two children could be either: (1) F, then M; (2) M, then F; (3) F,F; (4) M,M; (5) F,F identical twins; (6) F,F fraternal twins; (7) M,M identical twins; (8) M,M fraternal twins; or (9) M,F twins (emphasizing that birth order is irrelevant here when children are the same gender, when two children are within the same pair of twins and when pairs of twins have both the same gender(s) and identical-vs-fraternal characteristics). - _Rick L.
