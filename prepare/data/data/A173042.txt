    "example": [
        "For n=48: it is not decomposable using the algorithm in brackets, so instead of using the first s=36 we choose s=25 (the second largest). So the attempt to decompose 48 is now 5*5+(up to more 3 squares which will be found using steps 1 and 2 of the algorithm in brackets). This yields 5*5+4*4+2*2+1*1 which does not give 48 hence it is not decomposable using this algorithm."
