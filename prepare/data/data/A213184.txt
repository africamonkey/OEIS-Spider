        "The \"may\" in the definition should clarify that, e.g., 22900 is in the sequence since it may represent a date (Feb. 29), but not necessarily in any century (e.g., in 2000 but not in 1900), but 22900+k is present only for k=0 (mod 4).",
        "The sequence is finite, with 366*25 + 365*75 terms, cf. comment from G. Resta in A213182. The largest term is a(36525)=123199."
