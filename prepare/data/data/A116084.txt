        "Partial sums of A116085, which is more elementary to compute, cf. examples. Sequence A154888 has an equivalent definition except that i=j is allowed there, which yields the one-term sum 1/1 as an additional possibility, and thus A154888(n) = a(n)+1. Sequence A115855 is also about the same problem but does not require the fractions to be distinct. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 14 2016"
