        "If all integers were in A014567, then this sequence would not exist and we would be looking at A216200; but some are in A069059, allowing the trajectories of A017665 to go down.",
        "The term of the sequence correspond to the 5 cycles: [1], [15, 8], [448, 127, 128, 255, 144, 403], [1023, 512], [47360, 29127].",
        "Are there some starting x's whose fate will remain unknown, like 276 for A098007?",
        "Are there other cycles to be found?",

        "There are no other cycles with the smallest member < 10^11. All numbers < 10^11 reach one of the five known cycles. - _Donovan Johnson_, Jan 07 2014"
