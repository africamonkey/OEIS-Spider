    "comment": [
        "Since separability is not invariant under graph isomorphism, all 2^(n(2n-1))-1 nonzero Laplacian matrices are treated as different.  A nonzero Laplacian matrix different from the complete graph is separable in C^2 X C^n if and only if its complement is.  Since the complete graph is separable, this means that a(n) is odd for all n."
