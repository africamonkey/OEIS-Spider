        "The floor(n)-perfect numbers are the ordinary perfect numbers. The first three floor[1.001x]-perfect numbers are also ordinary perfect numbers and the first discrepancy comes at the fourth term, 32445 (the fourth perfect number is 8128). Consider other coefficients > 1 but < 1.001. There is some kind of continuity working here. The first discrepancies, if they exist, come at later and later terms as these coefficients are made closer to 1."
