    "comment": [
        "By a theorem of J. C. Lagarias, the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the proposition that this sequence never takes a negative value. In fact, by inspection it appears to be monotone increasing; this conjecture implies the Riemann hypothesis but is not in any obvious way implied by it. Stronger conjectures are easy to formulate--for example, if F(n) is the function defined by this sequence, then F(n)/2^n also appears to be monotone increasing."
