        "For the general array and triangle for the total number of round trips of length L on closed Laguerre graphs Lc_N see A201199. Here a(n)=w(4,L=n)/4, n>=0, the fourth row of this array divided by 4. In the corresponding triangle a(n) = A201199(n+3,4)/4, n>=0.",
        "For a sketch of the closed Laguerre graph Lc_4 see Figure 4 of the given W. Lang link. The o.g.f. is also found there.",
        "By definition the number of length 0 round trips for a vertex is put to 1 in order to count vertices.",
        "The average number of round trips of length n on a closed Laguerre graph Lc_N is in general a fraction. Therefore A201199 tabulates the total number of round trips."
