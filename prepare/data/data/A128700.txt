    "comment": [
        "Alaoglu and Erd\u0151s showed that 7200 is the largest highly abundant number with all the exponents of its prime factors occurring to powers greater than unity. It follows that the sequence of highly abundant numbers with an odd divisor sum is finite and is bounded above by 7200. Accordingly, this is the complete sequence of such integers."
