    "comment": [
        "By Fermat's Last Theorem, n^3 cannot be the difference nor the sum of 2 positive cubes, but n^3+1 or n^3-1 could be. If n^3-1 is also the sum of positive cubes and the difference of two other positives cubes besides n^3 and 1^3, then n is a term of the sequence. Interestingly, I have not been able to find numbers n such that n^3+1 is a difference of 2 positive cubes in 1 way and the sum of 2 positive cubes in 2 ways.",
        "Conjecture: if a term n is square, then 10000*n is also a term."
