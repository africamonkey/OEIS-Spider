        "A game is all-small if it and all its followers other than 0 have options for both players, or equivalently (under normal play rules) if it and all its followers are infinitesimal. \"All-small\" is the traditional term, although Aaron Siegel prefers \"dicotic\", attributed to Michael Weimerskirch.",
        "The all-small games born by day n form a distributive lattice if additional minimal and maximal elements are added.",
        "The values up to a(4) are due to Aaron Siegel, computed using cgsuite."
