    "name": "Number of non-isomorphic Average systems with n elements. An Average system has one binary operation \"avg\" and satisfies the three axioms avg(A,A)=A, avg(A,B)=avg(B,A), avg(avg(A,B),avg(C,D)) = avg(avg(A,C),avg(B,D)).",
    "comment": [
        "Axiom 1 is idempotence; axiom 2 is commutativity. The only unfamiliar axiom is the third one, mid-quarter-swap, a kind of tree-editing axiom. Together with commutativity, it allows free permutation of nodes at each specific level of a binary tree representing an expression.",
        "The Average axioms are also satisfied by lower semi-lattices, aka idempotent commutative semigroups, by finite Abelian groups with an odd number of elements and by hybrids of these two types."
