        "For each natural number taken in order, we consider if we can make it using digits from as many of the previous terms as we like. If we cannot, we add it to the sequence and add its digits to the 'pool' we have for making subsequent numbers."

    "example": [
        "This sequence is the same as A179309 up to 100. After that, we can make any three-digit number because we have had at least three of each digit so far. We can make 1000 because we have already had three 0's (in 10 and 100). So the next term is 1111 because we have only seen three 1's so far."
