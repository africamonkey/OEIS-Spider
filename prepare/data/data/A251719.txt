        "Provided that A250474 is strictly increasing (implied for example if either Legendre's or Brocard's conjecture is true) then all natural numbers occur in this sequence, in order, and after three 1's, each n+1 appears for the first time at A250474(n). Thus from n=2 onward, each n occurs A251723(n-1) times.",
