        "Conjecture: No two successive terms in the sequence differ by more than 1. Proof of this would prove the converse of the theorem that every prime is surrounded by two consecutive squares, namely |sqrt(p)|^2 and (|sqrt(p)|+1)^2. - _Cino Hilliard_, Jan 22 2003",

        "The above conjecture is Legendre's conjecture that for n > 0 there is always a prime between n^2 and (n+1)^2. See A014085, number of primes between two consecutive squares, which is also the number of times n is repeated in the present sequence. - _Jean-Christophe Herv\u00e9_, Oct 25 2013"
