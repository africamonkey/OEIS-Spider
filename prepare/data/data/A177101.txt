    "name": "The number of cycles in the Vers de Verres game, where 'worms' are transferred between 'cups' in a deterministic fashion. Because this defines a finite-state automaton, we know that every state eventually enters a cycle (or fixed point, which is essentially a cycle of length 1). The number of 'cups' (frequently called 'n') is a parameter for this automaton, and so we count the number of cycles (and fixed points) with respect to n.",
    "comment": [
        "The game is described in the websites listed, and already has other sequences, e.g. A151986 Note that this also gives the number of connected components, if we draw a graph of this process. The sequence gives the number of cycles, for a given number of cups. The sequence is increasing (append a 0 to all configurations in a cycle, and you get the same cycle with one more cup). It is strictly increasing since {n-1,0,0,0...,0} occurs in a cycle at stage n, but never before.",
        "I am not clear on how this is meant to differ from A176450; my calculations reproduce the terms there not the ones in this sequence. - _Joseph Myers_, Nov 13 2010"
