        "For sum of squares of two consecutive primes only 2^2+3^2=13 is prime. For sum of squares of three consecutive primes A133529 seems that only 83 belonging(checked for all n<1000000). Sums of squares of four (and all even number) of consecutive primes are even numbers with exception n=1 but 2^2+3^2+5^2+7^2=87=3*29 is not prime. Sums of squares of five of consecutive primes A133559."
