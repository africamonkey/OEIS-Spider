    "comment": [
        "For n >= 7, polyominoes can have holes whose boundaries are also included.",
        "An n-omino in the shape of a \"staircase\" has 2n boundary edges, so a(n) >= 2n.",
        "If we \"join\" copies of the X pentomino (sharing one square) then we can do better than the above lower bound. This gives us a(4k+1) >= 8k+4, for any k >= 0.",
        "It appears that a(n) = 2*n+2 for n (mod 4) == 1, otherwise a(n) = 2*n, which coincides with the lower bounds above. - _Lars Blomberg_, Nov 09 2017"
