    "comment": [
        "Since many people are not familiar with punch paper tape technology, we provide the following more formal description of the sequence, where each row on an n-hole paper tape is represented as an n-digit binary string, and nonzero bits correspond to punched holes.",
        "a(n) is the maximum number of symbols that can be encoded by a set of n-bit binary strings which can be split up as a disjoint union of two sets (\"encoding schemes\") E1 and E2, such that each symbol s has exactly one code in E1, and one or more codes in E2 such that any other symbol's code from E1 can be transformed to one of the encodings of s (in E1 or E2) by flipping one or more bits from 0 to 1.",
        "Each n-bit encoding in E1 and E2 must map to exactly one symbol; two different symbols cannot share the same n-bit encoding.",
        "This sequence was inspired by the Punch-22 puzzle published by J. Kennedy and solved by J. Cristobal Olivares, cf links.",
        "Ronald L. Rivest and Adi Shamir explored these types of problems extensively in their 1982 paper, which provides a solution to the Punch-22 puzzle; thus, a(7) >= 26. The paper states that a(7) cannot be 29. Thus, a(7) is 26, 27 or 28. Using notation from their paper, a(n) is equal to the maximum k, such that a <k>^2/n WOM-code exists.",
        "a(n) >= n+1 for n>2 since a \"trivial\" encoding system of n+1 symbols is to assign them the codes c[k]=2^(k-1) for k=1..n and c[n+1]=0, and as second code the 1's complement, i.e., d[k] = 2^n-1-c[k]. Therefore, a(5) >= 6, which improves the lower bound 2^floor(n/2). For n >= 6 this bound is less than 2^floor(n/2). This latter bound is obtained by assigning to the 2^[n/2] symbols the codes c[k] = k-1, 1 <= k <= 2^[n/2], as well as, for k>1, all the codes of the form c[k]*2^[n/2]+x where x takes all values different from c[k], while the codes c[k]*(2^[n/2]+1) would represent the first symbol also coded c[1]=0. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 02 2015",
        "The lower bound follows from considering the code as concatenation of two smaller codes. The upper bound is derived from that fact that the worst case minimum number of holes to be punched during the first write determines the maximum reachable alphabet size using the remaining unpunched holes. For the lower and upper bounds see Formula section. - _Bert Dobbelaere_, Feb 12 2017"
