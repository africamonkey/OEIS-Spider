        "This is to numbers that are the sum of 4 different primes (A177708) as primorials (A002110) are to primes (A000040). The subsequence of primes among these sums of 4 distinct primorials begins: 2347, 2551, 30271, 32371, 510751. The subsequence of nontrivial powers a^b with b>1 begin: a(3) = 243, a(24) = 30276 = 30030+210+30+6 = 2^2 x 3^2 x 29^2."
