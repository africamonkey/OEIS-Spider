        "From Figure 9, p.14 of Lemoine. For whether or not there is a winning strategy obtained from a starting position with n points, see A164950. Sprouts is a two-player topological game, invented in 1967 by Michael Paterson and John Conway. The game starts with p spots, lasts at most 3p-1 moves, and the player who makes the last move wins. In the misere version of Sprouts, on the contrary, the player who makes the last move loses."
