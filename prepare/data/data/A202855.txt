        "The sequence b(n) = 4*A050474(n) is a subsequence of this sequence, and comprises solutions of n/(phi(n) - 1) = 4, accounting for all terms up to a(9) except a(1) and a(3). Proof: suppose n/(phi(n) - 1) = 4. With n = 4*x, x/(phi(4*x) - 1) = 1, or phi(4*x) = x + 1. Since phi(k) is even for k > 2, x is odd, and phi(4*x) = 2*phi(x) = x + 1, the definition of A050474. It follows that 4*A050474(8) = 27971850688528380 is a term of this sequence. - _Chris Boyd_, Mar 22 2015",
