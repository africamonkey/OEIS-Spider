        "Note that a(n) is an n-almost prime. An n-almost prime is a number having exactly n prime factors (counted with multiplicity). So 1 is the only 0-almost prime; 1-almost primes are the usual prime numbers; 2-almost primes are also called semiprimes. The first three terms are mentioned in A125149."
