        "The number of labelled increasing unary-binary trees with an associated permutation avoiding 231 and 312 simultaneously (or avoids 312 and 321 simultaneously) in the classical sense.  The tree\u2019s permutation is found by recording the labels in the order they appear in a breadth-first search.  (Note that a breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree labels left to right by levels, starting with the root).",
        "In some cases, the same breadth-first search reading permutation can be found on differently shaped trees.  This sequence gives the number of trees, not the number of permutations."
