        "A005245 Complexity of n: number of 1's required to build n using + and * (and parentheses). A005520 Smallest number of complexity n: smallest number requiring n 1's to build using + and *. Now consider the recursion: A005245(n), A005245(A005245(n)), A005245(A005245(A005245(n))), ... which we know is finite before reaching a fixed point, as A005245(n) <= n. The number of steps needed to reach such a fixed point is the complexity height of n (with respect to the A005245 measure of complexity, there being others in the OEIS)."
