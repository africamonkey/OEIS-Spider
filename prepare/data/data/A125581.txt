It may also contain some \"isolated\" terms (i.e. not participating in the geometric progressions) but such terms are harder to find and at the moment I have no proof that they exist.",

        "Proof. It is enough to show that valuation(H(b*p^n),p)>-n and valuation(H'(b*p^n),p)>-n. By Lemma 2 we have valuation(H(b*p^n),p) >= valuation(H(b),p) - n >= 1-n > -n.",
