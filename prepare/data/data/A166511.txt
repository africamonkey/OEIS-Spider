        "A comma number n is the concatenation of numbers a,b (no leading zeros allowed) which occurs (\"again\") in the comma sequence S = S(a,b) defined by S[0]=a, S[1]=b, S[n+1] = S[n] + 10*last_digit(S[n-1]) + first_digit(S[n]), i.e., add to a given term the number formed by the two digits surrounding the preceding comma.",
        "The sequence S is infinite and straightforward to compute, in contrast to the implicitly defined terms of A121805.",
        "The sequence S(a,b) is strictly increasing, unless a=0 (mod 10) and b=0 (which implies n=0 (mod 100)), in which case all following terms are zero."
