    "name": "Number of different stationary distributions of a certain random walk whose states are permutations of 1,...,n. The transitions depend on two sorted vectors x and z. The state sigma goes to rank((z[sigma]-x)[rperm] +x), where rperm is a random (uniform) permutation. If x and z are realizations of independent random variables X and Z and pi is a permutation drawn from the stationary distribution, the vector z[pi]-x is a realization of a random variable Y where Z ~ X+Y.",
