        "Let r and b be positive real numbers. We define an Engel expansion of r to the base b to be a (possibly infinite) nondecreasing sequence of positive integers [a(0), a(1), a(2), ...] such that we have the series representation r = b/a(0) + b^2/(a(0)*a(1)) + b^3/(a(0)*a(1)*a(2)) + .... Depending on the values of r and b such an expansion may not exist, and if it does exist it may not be unique.",
        "When b = 1 we recover the ordinary Engel expansion of r. See A181565 and A230601 for some predictable Engel expansions to a base b other than 1.",

        "Define the map f(x) (which depends on the base b) by f(x) = x/b*ceiling(b/x) - 1 and let f^(n)(x) denote the n-th iterate of the map f(x), with the convention that f^(0)(x) = x.",
        "For n = 0, 1, 2, ... define the integer a(n) = ceiling(b/f^(n)(r)) until f^n(r) = 0.",
        "When b >= 1 and 0 < r < b the sequence a(n) produced by this algorithm provides an Engel expansion of r to the base b.",
        "For the present sequence we apply this algorithm with r := 1 and with the base b := Pi.",
        "We can also get an alternating series representation for r in powers of b (still assuming b >= 1 and 0 < r < b), called a Pierce series expansion of r to the base b, by running the above algorithm but now with input values -r and base b. See A232326.",
        "In addition, we can obtain two further series expansions for r in powers of b by running the algorithm with either the input values r and base -b or with the input values -r and base -b. See examples below. See A232327 and A232328 for other examples of these types of expansions."
