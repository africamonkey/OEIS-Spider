    "comment": [
        "The Euclid-Mullin graph encodes all instances of Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes. This sequences gives the number of nodes appearing at each level in the graph, when starting the graph from 1.",
        "a(13) is almost certainly 7950 but requires the factorization of a 253-digit number to confirm."

        "Level 0 contains the single node 1, so a(0)=1.",
        "Level 1 contains the prime factors of 1+1, i.e., 2, so a(1)=2.",
        "The first interesting level is Level 5, which has the factors of 1*2*3*7*43+1 which are 13 and 139, hence a(5)=2.",
        "At higher levels there can be more than one path from a node back to the root."
