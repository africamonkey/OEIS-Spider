        "If each box may contain at most one (possibly nested) box then the Bell numbers (A000110) are obtained, whereas if each box may contain at most two smaller (possibly nested) boxes then A000772 is obtained and if no restriction is placed on the number of (possible nested) boxes that any box may contain then the factorial numbers (A000142) are obtained. Sequence suggested by an earlier submission of _Rick L. Shepherd_."
