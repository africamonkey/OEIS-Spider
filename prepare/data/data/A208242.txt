        "These numbers are the only known solutions of the Nagell-Ljunggren equation, there are no other solutions for n < 10000. Yann Bugeaud and Maurice Mignotte propose two alternative conjectures:",
        "A) the Nagell-Ljunggren equation has only these three solutions, but this conjecture seems too ambitious, so the other one:",
        "B) the number of solutions is finite seems more credible, and this last conjecture is true if abc-conjecture is true [see article in reference and the conjecture 2 in link \"Les nombres br\u00e9siliens\"].",
        "Also 121 is the only square of prime which is Brazilian."
