        "There are 8 values of a(n) < 1000 although A045345 has 4 values A045345(n) < 1000. How do these sequences compare asymptotically?",
        "Heuristics suggest that the ratio of the number of terms in each sequence up to x should approach 1 as x increases without bound. In the Cram\u00e9r model, log a(n) and log A045345(n) are Erlang-distributed with shape n and rate 1. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 20 2015"
