        "Because if m is not of the form x^2 + n*y^2 and m^(r-2) is not of the form x^2 + n*y^2, but m^r = a^2 + n*b^2, then m^(r+2) = (m*a)^2+n*(m*b)^2, m^(r+4) = (m^2*a)^2+n*(m^2*b)^2, etc. are also of the form x^2 + n*y^2. Then m^(3*r-6) = (m^(r-2))^3 = (m^(r-3)*a)^2 + n*(m^(r-3)*b)^2 is of the form x^2 + n*y^2 and m^(r-2) is not of the form x^2 + n*y^2.",
