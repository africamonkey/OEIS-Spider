        "Inspired by A061777, let us assign label \"1\" to an origin square; at n-th generation add a square at each expandable vertex, i.e. a vertex such that the new added generations will not overlap to the existing ones, but overlapping among new generations are allowed. The non-overlapping squares will have the same label value as a predecessor; for the overlapping ones, the label value will be sum of label values of predecessors. The squares count is A001844. See illustration. For n >= 1, (a(n) - a(n-1))/4 is A000225."
