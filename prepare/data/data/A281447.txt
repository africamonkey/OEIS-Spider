        "Although numbers of the form ((5*p)^4 - 1)/3 appear in the beginning of sequence, note that not all terms are of the form ((5*p)^4 - 1)/3, i.e., (6239^16-1)/3.",

Since 24 * A000217(k) + 4 is not divisible by 3, 3*n + 1 cannot be a refactorable number when n is an odd refactorable number.",
        "Since we proved that n is an even number, 3 * n + 1 is odd and it must be a square. If 3 * n + 1 = (2 * t + 1)^2, then n = ((2 * t + 1)^2 - 1) / 3 = 4 * t * (t + 1) / 3 = 8 * A001318(m). (End)"
