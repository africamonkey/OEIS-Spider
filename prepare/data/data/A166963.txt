        "Trivially, this also counts 180-degree symmetric permutations avoiding 321 and 4123, 123 and 3214, or 321 and 2341. For the other 140 pairs of patterns in S_3 and S_4, the sequence of symmetric permutations avoiding those patterns is either finite (as in 123 and 4321, by Erdos-Szekeres) or counted by an easily-recognized sequence such as alternating Fibonacci numbers, Catalan numbers, squares plus one, or the naturals."
