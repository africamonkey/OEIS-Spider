        "It is highly likely that the sequence is finite.  For each m, there are at most 4 powers of 2 with m digits.  If m is large, of the 9*10^m numbers with m digits, there are at most about c * 10^m/m^(9/2) with equal digit frequencies where c is a constant (this comes from the case where there all 10 digits are represented with frequencies m/10).   Thus heuristically the expected number of m-digit powers of 2 with equal digit frequencies decreases like m^(-9/2), and this has a finite sum. (End)"
