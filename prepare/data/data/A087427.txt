        "Koshy, p. 499, states \"We now employ this geometric approach to establish the lemma. It is due to the German mathematician Ferdinand Eisenstein, a student of Gauss at Berlin\"., (where the geometric lemma applies to the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity, Koshy, p. 501): \"let p and q be distinct odd primes. then (p/q)(q/p) = (-1)^[(p-1)/2 * (q-1)/2].\""
