        "A solid standard Young tableaux (SSYT) with n cells is a way of placing the integers from 1 to n in a 3D Young diagram of a plane partition with the property that the entries increase from left to right, back to front, and bottom to top.",
        "It is also the number of almost topological sequences (ATS) for the set N^3 at depth n with (N=set of nonnegative integers). See Balakrishnan et al. for definition and a proof of the bijection between SSYT and ATS. - _Suresh Govindarajan_, Mar 02 2012"
