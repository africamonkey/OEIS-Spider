    "comment": [
        "Some numbers appear to grow indefinitely under these rules, but it is possible that they may eventually cycle at some point.  All numbers up to 50 either cycle or transform to another number that cycles (typically 1).  51 is the first open case: it may eventually cycle or may continue to grow indefinitely."
