        "Annals of Statistics 2007, Vol. 35, No. 2, 793-814; from the abstract: [...]. In this paper, we provide a complete solution to enumerating nonisomorphic two-level orthogonal arrays of strength d with d+2 constraints for any d and any run size n = lambda(2^d). Our results not only give the number of nonisomorphic orthogonal arrays for given $d$ and $n$, but also provide a systematic way of explicitly constructing these arrays. [...]."
