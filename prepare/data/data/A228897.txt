    "comment": [
        "The tree has infinitely many branches which are essentially linear recurrence sequences (and infinitely many which are not).  The extreme branches are (1,2)->(2,3)->(3,5)->(5,8)->... and (1,2)->(2,4)->(4,8)->(8,32)->...  These branches contribute to A228897, as subsequences, the Fibonacci numbers, A000045, and the sequence 2^(A000045) = A000302."
