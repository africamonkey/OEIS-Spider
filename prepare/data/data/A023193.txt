        "The (wrong) old name was: Largest number of pairwise coprime numbers that can occur in an interval of length n. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 10 2017",
        "Conjecturally, a(n) is the largest number of primes that occurs on an infinite number of intervals of n consecutive integers. The conjecture is apparently due to Dickson; Hardy & Littlewood's Conjecture B concerns only pairs (p, p + 2n).",
        "According to the link at www.opertech.com, a(3159) >= 447 > 446 = pi(3159). The k-tuples conjecture then implies that, for an infinitude of n, the interval [n+1, n+3159] includes 447 primes. For these n, pi(n+3159) >= pi(n)+447 > pi(n)+446 = pi(n)+pi(3159), contradicting the conjecture that pi(x+y) <= pi(x)+pi(y). - _David W. Wilson_, May 23 2005",
        "From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 10 2017: (Start)",
        "The following admissibility definition is adapted from the Hensley and Richards [H-R] or Richards [R] links. A k-tuple B_k = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_k] of integers with 0 <= b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_k is admissible if, for each prime p, there exists at least one congruence class modulo p which contains none of the B_k members. Because complete residue systems modulo p are equivalent under translation one can consider the length n interval [0, 1, ..., n-1] and admissible k-tuples starting with 0. The prime p = 2 allows then only even tuple numbers from I_n = [0, 2, ..., floor((n-1)/2)]. Only primes p <= k have to be tested.",
        "a(n) is then the maximal k for which there is at least one such admissible B_k tuple from the interval I_n. This function a(n) is called rho^* in (H-R) and (R). It has been given as rhobar in the Schinzel - Sierpi\u0144ski link, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 1., p. 201.",
        "Note that there are also admissible k-tuples from members of [0, 1, ..., n-1]  which do not start with 0. Such tuples are translations of the ones starting with 0. E.g., [1, 3] is an admissible 2-tuple for any [0, 1,..., n-1] interval with n >= 3, but it is a translation of the considered [0, 2] tuple.",
        "For the multiplicities of k see A047947(k), for k >= 1.",
        "For the smallest k such that a(k) = n see A020497(n), for k >= 1.",
        "For the number of all admissible k-tuples from the interval I_n starting with 0 see the array A292224(n, k), with k = 1..a(n), which has been given in the Engelsma link, Table 2, p. 27.",
        "One of the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures (the prime tuple conjecture, see also conjecture (B) given by [H-R] and [R], and Ribenboim, hypothesis (D_1), p. 373, from the Dickson conjecture) is that there are infinitely many primes with gaps defined by any admissible B_k tuple, that is, all p, p + b_2, ..., p + b_k are prime for infinitely many primes p, for k >= 2. For k = 1 this is well known.",
