        "From _Bob Selcoe_, Feb 24 2014: (Start)",
        "The sequence consists of all odd primes and powers of two (>=2^2) and no other terms.",
        "Proof: Denote the even anti-divisors of n as ADe(n). ADe(n) is defined as the set of numbers x satisfying the equation n(mod x)=x/2. Substitute x = 2n/y, since it can be shown that ADe(n) => 2n divided by the odd divisors of n when n>1 (This is because 2j anti-divides only numbers of the form 3j+2j*k; j>=1, k>=0.  For example: j=7; 14 anti-divides only 21,35,49,63.... So in other words, even numbers anti-divide only odd multiples (>=3) of themselves, divided by 2). Therefore, ADe(n) is n(mod [2n/y])=n/y, and y must be an odd divisor of n and 2n, y>1.  Since y is the only odd divisor of n when y>1 iff n is prime, then ADe(n) => 2 when n is prime.  Since 2n has no odd divisors when n=2^k, then ADe(n) is null when n=2^k.  Therefore, the only numbers whose anti-divisors are either 2 or odd must be primes and powers of 2.",
        "Similarly, for odd anti-divisors (ADo(n)): Given 2j+1 (odd numbers) anti-divide only numbers of the forms [(3j+1)+(2j+1)*k] and [(3j+2)+(2j+1)*k]; j>=1, k>=0. (For example: j=6; 13 anti-divides only 19,20, 32,33, 45,46...). Since odd n divided by its odd divisors ARE its odd divisors, then ADo(n) => the divisors of 2n-1 and 2n+1 (except 1, 2n-1 and 2n+1).",
        "By extension:",
        "1) Numbers all of whose anti-divisors (ADs) are odd => {2^k} (A000079).",
        "2) Numbers with ADe(n)=2, all other ADs odd => primes (A000040).",
        "3) Numbers none of whose ADs are multiples of j => j*2^k.",
        "4) When 2n-1 and 2n+1 are twin primes, (A040040, except for a(0)=1) then n has only even ADs.",
