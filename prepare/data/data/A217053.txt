        "The Ramanujan type sequence number 9 for the argument 2Pi/9 defined by the following relation a(n)*3^(-n + 1/3) = ((-1))^n)*(c(1) - 1/3)^(n + 2/3) + ((-1)^n)*(c(2) - 1/3)^(n + 2/3) + (1/3 - c(4))^(n + 2/3), where c(j) := 2*cos(2*Pi*j/9). We note that c(4) = -cos(Pi/9). The conjugate with a(n) are the sequences A217052 and A217069.",
        "In Witula's et al.'s paper the following sequence is discussed: S(n) := sum{j=0,1,2} (1/3 - c(2^j))^(n/3). It is proved that S(n+3) = (3^(1/3))*S(n+1) + S(n)/3, n=0,1,... Moreover the following decomposition holds true S(n) = x(n) + y(n)*3^(1/3) + z(n)*9^(1/3), which implies the system of recurrence relations: x(n+3) = 3*z(n+1) + x(n)/3, y(n+3) = x(n+1) + y(n)/3, z(n+3) = y(n+1) + z(n)/3, x(0)=3, y(0)=z(0)=x(1)=y(1)=z(1)=x(2)=z(2)=0, y(2)=2. Then it can be generated the relations X'(n+9) - 3*X'(n+6) - 24*X'(n+3) - X'(n) = 0, where X'(n) = X(n)*3^n for every X=x,y,z and n=0,1,..., from which we obtain that x(3*n+1)=x(3*n+2)=y(3*n)=y(3*n+1)=z(3*n)=z(3*n+2)=0 and a(n) = y(3*n+2)*3^n, A217052(n) = x(3*n)*3^(n-1), and A217069(n) = z(3*n+1)*3^(n-1).",
