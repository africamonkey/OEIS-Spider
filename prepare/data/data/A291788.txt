        "There is a similar proof that all the terms from 48 though 152 have a trajectory that merges with the trajectory of 45, and so doubles every 7 steps after a certain point. For example, the trajectory of 152 reaches 2^106*33 at step 390, is 2^107*33 at step 397, and thereafter doubles every 7 steps.- _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 24 2017"
