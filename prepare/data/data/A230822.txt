        "If making a statistical bar chart with x-axis denoting the number of decompositions of an even number, and y-axis denoting the number of hits of an x-axis value for all 3 <= k <= m, there are one or more commonest x value presenting with highest y value.  Such commonest x values increase when m increases. a(n) is the smallest m value to make A230762(n) one of the commonest number or prime decomposition of 2k in the range of 3 <= k <= m.",
        "Hypothesis: With the increase of m, the commonest number of decompositions of 2k into an unordered sum of two odd primes in the range of 3 <= k <= m ascends.",
