        "A prime p is in class 1- if p-1 has no prime factor larger than 3. If p-1 has other prime factors, p is in class (c+1)-, where c- is the largest class of its prime factors. See also A005109.",

These upper limits can be found by generating class (n+1)- primes from a list of n- class primes; if the latter is sufficiently complete, one can deduce that there is no smaller (n+1)- prime. - _M.
