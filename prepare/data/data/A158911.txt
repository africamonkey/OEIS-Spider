        "The entries correspond to positional information of A156703, which stem from ratios of consecutive integers. For example, A156703(4)=875 yields a(5). This is because 875 was produced from n/(n+1) where n=7, i.e., 7/8 = 0.875.  Similarly, a(23)=399 stems from 399/400=0.9975 (A156703(22)). - _Bill McEachen_, Jan 05 2014"
