        "This is the result of trying to infer the rules behind A056755. The match is not exact - these rules allow 16 3-celled polyominoes not allowed in A056755. However, the reason for the exclusion of those 16 polyominoes in A056755 is not clear.",
        "The restrictions are: all curved edges must be on the boundary of the polyomino, each side of the polyomino must be either all curved, or all straight and if two cells meet on a side of length 2, they must share the whole side. Polyominoes are allowed to be rotated and reflected.",
        "See the Applegate link for further information."
