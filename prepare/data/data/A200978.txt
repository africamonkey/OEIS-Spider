        "a(4)=72 since there are 72 ways to arrange books b1, b2, b3, and b4 on 3 consecutive shelves s1, s2, and s3. Note that there are 24 arrangements with two books on shelf si (i=1,2,3) and one book on each of the other two shelves. (For instance, there are 12 ways to select and permute the two books for s1 and 2 ways to select the single books for s2 and s3.) Hence there are 3(24)=71 book arrangements."
