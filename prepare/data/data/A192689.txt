        "25 is the only member of sequence that does not end in 6. Proof: All squares end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. 0, 1, 4, 9 can be ruled out because they're squares themselves. This leaves only 5 and 6. 25 qualifies. However, all squares that end in 5 end in 25, making it impossible for a square number ending in 5 with more than 2 digits to qualify, leaving only 6 as a valid final digit for all members of this sequence with 3 or more digits."
