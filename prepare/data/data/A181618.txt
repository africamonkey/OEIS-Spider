        "A series of n games are played between two teams. The outcome of each game is either a win, a loss or a draw. A team wins the whole series if it has more wins than its opponent. If the difference between the number of wins of each team is k and there are less than k games remaining in the series, then the remaining games are dead. The outcome of the dead games cannot affect the outcome of the series.",

    "example": [
        "We can represent an n-game series as a ternary string of length n, where '0' means a draw, '1' means loss for the first team and '2' means a win for the first team. For n=3 there are 3^3=27 possible game series. Out of these there are 6 that contain at least one dead game (the last one): 110, 111, 112, 220, 221, 222. Hence a(3)=6."
