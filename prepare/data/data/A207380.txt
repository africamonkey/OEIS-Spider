    "comment": [
        "In this model each part of a partition can be represented by a cuboid of size 1 x 1 x L, where L is the size of the part. One of the views is a rectangle formed by ones whose area is n*A000041(n) = A066186(n). Each element of the first view is equal to the volume of a horizontal column parallel to the axis x. The second view is the n-th slice illustrated in A026792 which has A000041(n) levels and its area is A006128(n) equals the total number of parts of all partitions of n and equals the sum of largest parts of all partitions of n. Each zone contains a partition of n. Each element of the second view is equal to the volume of a horizontal column parallel to the axis y. The third view is a triangle because it is also the n-th slice of the tetrahedron of A209655. The area of triangle is A000217(n). Each element of the third view is equal to the volume of a vertical column parallel to the axis z. The sum of elements of each view is A066186(n) equals the area of the first view. For more information about the shell model of partitions see A135010 and A182703."
