        "This sequence gives also the curvature of touching circles inscribed in a special way in the smaller segment of circle of radius 5/4 divided by a chord of length 2.",
        "Consider a circle C of radius 5/4 (in some length units) with a chord of length 2. This has been chosen such that the larger sagitta has also length 2. The smaller sagitta has length 1/2. The input, besides the circle C is the circle C_0 with radius R_0 = 1/4, touching the chord and circle C. The following sequence of circles C_n with radii R_n, n >= 1, is obtained from the condition that C_n touches i) the circle C, ii) the chord and iii) the circle C)(n-1). The circle curvatures C_n = 1/R_n, n >= 0, are conjectured to be a(n). See an illustration given in the link. As found by Wolfdieter Lang (see part II of the proof given by W. Lang in the link), this circle problem is related to the nonnegative solutions of the Pell equation X^2 - 5*Y^2 = 4: a(n) = 2 + X(n) = 2 + A005248(n). For the larger segment below the chord (with sagitta length 2) the sequence would be A115032, see W. Lang's proof given in part I of the link.",
        "  If the circle radius and the sagitta length were both equal to 1, the curvature sequence would be A099938."
