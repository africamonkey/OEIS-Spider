    "comment": [
        "Subsequence of A020472. The primes generated from the subtractions are in A020469, A020458, and A020449, respectively. Final digits are necessarily 9 (here), then 7, 3, and 1. Because leading 8's are permitted in the terms here, the primes generated by subtracting 8's may have fewer digits than the others."
