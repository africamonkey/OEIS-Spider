        "To win a game, you must flip n+1 heads in a row, where n is the total number of tails flipped so far. The probability of having won before n+1 tails (that is, winning by flipping n+1 or fewer heads in a row) is A114604 / A006125 The probability of winning for the first time after n tails (that is, by flipping n+1 heads in a row) is A005329 / A006125."
