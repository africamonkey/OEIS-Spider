    "comment": [
        "For powers of 2 less than 2^1000, representations in base 3 are the only nontrivial examples where these kinds of pairs can be found. In other bases, for any integer n > 1, 2^(n+2) has the same frequency of digits as 2^(2n), represented in base (2^n)+1. (e.g. 2^3 and 2^4 in base 5, 2^4 and 2^6 in base 9, 2^5 and 2^8 in base 17, etc.).",
        "For any n > 0, it can be shown that the distribution of these terms is approximately k*log(n), with k a small constant. This distribution can be derived from empirical evidence detailed in sequences A056734, A056735 and A056736."
