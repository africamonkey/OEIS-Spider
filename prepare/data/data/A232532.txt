        "With n = 5, the equation a^2 + 15b^2 = 3c^2 + 5d^2 has no solutions in positive integers for a, b, c, d as the following proof shows: Assume gcd(a, b, c, d) = 1, otherwise if gcd(a, b, c, d) = g, then a/g, b/g, c/g, d/g would be a smaller set of solutions to the equation. We have a^2 - 3c^2 == 0 (mod 5). Since a square is always congruent to 0, 1, or 4 (mod 5), this is possible if and only if a == c == 0 (mod 5). Now let a = 5p, c = 5q, so a^2 + 15b^2 = 3c^2 + 5d^2 gives 25p^2 + 15b^2 = 75q^2 + 5d^2, i.e. 5p^2 + 3b^2 = 15q^2 + d^2 so 3b^2 - d^2 == 0 (mod 5). By the same argument this is possible if and only if b == d == 0 (mod 5). We already showed that a == c == 0 (mod 5), so gcd(a, b, c, d) is a multiple of 5. This contradicts our assumption that gcd(a, b, c, d) = 1 and so no such solution exists.",
        "Similarly one can prove other values of n with modulo n arithmetic if the only solution to a^2 - 3*d^2 == 0 (mod n) is a == 0 (mod n) and d == 0 (mod n). If r is a prime factor of n and if r^2 does not divide n and the equation a^2 - 3*d^2 == 0 (mod r) has the only solution a == 0 (mod r) and d == 0 (mod r), we can also take modulo r arithmetic to prove that n is a member of this sequence.",
        "On the other hand, if we take modulo 3 arithmetic and if a^2 - n*d^2 == 0 (mod 3) has the only solution a == 0 (mod 3) and d == 0 (mod 3), then n is a member of this sequence. This happens if n == 2 (mod 3).",
        "If n = 3k is not a multiple of 9, a must be a multiple of 3. Putting a = 3p and dividing the equation by 3 gives 3(p^2+k*b^2) = (c^2+k*d^2). This equation has no solution in positive integers p, b, c, d if and only if there is no number of the form x^2+k*y^2 that is thrice another number that of the same form x^2+k*y^2.",
