        "A Boolean function is ultrasweet if it is sweet (see A114302) under all permutations of the variables.",
        "Two students, Shaddin Dughmi and Ian Post, have identified these functions as precisely the monotone Boolean functions whose prime implicants are the bases of a matroid, together with the constant function 0. This explains why a(n) = A058673(n) + 1."
