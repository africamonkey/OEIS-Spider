        "Conjecture: The terms of any feasible prime gap triple {a,b,c} to form a quadruple of consecutive primes are sums of terms of three consecutive subsequences of the infinite integer sequence with period (4,2,4,2,4,6,2,6). By this token all possible sequences of quadruples of consecutive primes can be generated, including those already in OEIS."
