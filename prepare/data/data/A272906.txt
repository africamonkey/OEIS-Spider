        "The problem is to cut a disk with n chords, no three of which may meet at a single strictly-interior point. For each such slicing, construct the graph on vertices (pieces of the pizza) connected by edges (line segments separating two pieces). a(n) gives the number of such graphs up to isomorphism.",
        "This is an empirical result, obtained from guided random trials. Independent programs agree up to and including a(5)=130. Term a(6)=1814 is unconfirmed.",
        "A054499, counting chord diagrams, is a loose lower bound."
