        "All terms beyond m=9 are only conjectures found by numerical experimentation. The density is defined as the fraction of the volume of the large sphere occupied by the small spheres. For 2 spheres the density is 0.25. The first known configuration with density exceeding 0.5 occurs for 31 spheres.",
