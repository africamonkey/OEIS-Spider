        "Suppose a number is of the form a=10...01 then a^2=10..020..01, so a^2 is always a palindrome. a^3=10..030..030..01, so a^3 is always a palindrome. Similarly we also have a^4=10..040..060..040..01, so a^4 is always a palindrome. However, a^5 is in general not a palindrome, for example 101^5=10510100501. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Apr 17 2009",
