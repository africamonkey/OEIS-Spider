        "Exercise 14 on page 30 of the Long textbook is \"Let m_1, m_2, m_3 ... be an infinite sequence of integers such that m_i >= 2 for all i. Let M_0 = 1 and M_i = prod(j=1,...,i) m_j for all i >= 1. Show that every nonnegative integer r can be written uniquely in the form r = c_n M_n + c_(n-1) M_(n-1) + ... + c_1 M_1 + c_0 where c_n <> 0 for r <> 0 and 0 <= c_i < m_(i+1) for all i.\" The current sequence of terms a(r) = (c_n c_(n-1) ... c_1 c_0 concatenated) is one example of an infinite family of hybrid representations (just using only 2 and 3). For the m_i, this sequence uses A010693. Then the corresponding M_i are A026549. Thus the places reading from right have values (1,2,2*3,2*3*2,2*3*2*3,...) = A026549. The (ternary) digit 2 may only appear in the even positions counting from the rightmost as position 1. Appending \"00\" to any term multiplies the number by 6.",
        "However, appending a single \"0\" to a term multiplies the number by 2 or by 3 or produces an invalid string of digits -- or even none of the above (110 => 1100, 8 becomes 18) -- depending upon the original number and its length."
