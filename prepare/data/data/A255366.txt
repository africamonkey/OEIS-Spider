        "First differs from A162795 at a(14), but it appears that then they share infinitely many terms. It appears that this is very close to A162795 rather than both A147562 and A169707.",
        "The graphs of both A162795 and this sequence are intertwined.",
        "Note that there are four main versions of this cellular automaton, depending on whether the wedges with the same rule are opposite or perpendicular and also depending on whether each mentioned version is represented by the \"one-step rook\" illustration or by the \"one-step bishop\" illustration. The four versions are represented by this sequence.",
