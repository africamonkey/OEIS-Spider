        "With a regular deck of 52 playing cards (4 suits of 13 cards: 23456789TJQKA) a \"straight flush\" consists of 5 cards of the same suit with consecutive values. The ace (A) is considered to come either before the deuce (2) or after the king (K).",
        "The first terms of the sequence are zero because there are no straight flushes in a hand of fewer than 5 cards."
