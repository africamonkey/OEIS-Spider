        "Given an subgroup g of S(n) that is unknown and an oracle which takes as input a permutation on n elements, and returns true IFF the permutation is a member of the subgroup; a(n) is the minimum number of permutations that need to be queried to prove g consists of only the identity permutation.",

There is a directed edge from i->j IFF the permutation label on vertex j is in the group generated by the single permutation designated by the label on i.",
