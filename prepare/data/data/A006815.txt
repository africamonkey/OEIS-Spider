        "After constructing a self-avoiding walk, bridge together all adjacent neighboring sites on the walk. a(n) is the sum of the lengths of the shortest path in each of the resulting structures from beginning to end (i.e., using the original path and any bridges), across all walks of length n. My attempt to compute this sequence diverges from the listed terms at n=9, for which I get a(9)=27511, a(10)=82938, .... - _Sean A. Irvine_, Aug 09 2017"
