        "The total number of n-ary operators in a k-valued logic is T = k^(k^n), i.e. if S is a set of k elements, there are T ways of mapping an ordered subset of n elements taken from S to an element of S. Some operators are \"degenerate\": the operator has arity p, if only p of the n input values influence the output. Therefore the set of operators can be partitioned into n+1 disjoint subsets representing arities from 0 to n."
