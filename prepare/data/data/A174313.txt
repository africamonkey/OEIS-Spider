        "The hexagonal lattice is the familiar 2-dimensional lattice in which each point has 6 neighbors. This is sometimes called the triangular lattice.",
        "Fisher and Hiley give 290334 and 839466 as their last terms instead of 290322 and 839382 (see A002933).  Douglas McNeil confirms the correction on the seqfan list Nov 27 2010."
