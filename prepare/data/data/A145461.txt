    "comment": [
        "If a number is written in base 10 with a digit x and in base b with a digit y, then (b-1)*x*10^n - 9*y*b^m + (9*y - (b-1)*x) = 0. Varying parameters b=2,3,...,9; x=1,2,...,9; and y=1,2,...,b-1 give a finite number of equations. It is easy to find all solutions (w.r.t. n and m) of each equation or establish that there are none. In particular, for b=7, x=9, y=5, the equation is 54*10^n - 45*7^m - 9 = 0 or 6*10^n - 5*7^m - 1 = 0 that does not have solutions since the left hand side is not 0 modulo 5. (Alekseyev)"
