        "Since 8 is not a prime, no element > 1 of the sequence A001018(k)=8^k (having k+1 digits in base 8, but much more divisors) can be member of this sequence. Also, no power of a prime less than 8 can be in the sequence, since it will always have fewer divisors than digits in base 8. However all powers of 11 up to 11^6 are in this sequence, having the same number of digits (in base 8) than the same power of 8 (since 6 = floor(log(11/8)/log(8))) and also that number of divisors (since 11 is prime)."
