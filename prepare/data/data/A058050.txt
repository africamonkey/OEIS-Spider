    "name": "a(n) is the number of different graphs drawn in the following way: you decide for each number k <= n a pair of positive numbers (x(k),y(k)) such that x(k)+y(k)=k; you draw n points numbered 1 to n; draw two arrows from n, one to x(n) and one to y(n); draw two arrows from each k already reached by an arrow, one to x(k) and one to y(k). The process stops when 1 is the only point reached by an arrow without any arrow leaving it; you can also erase the isolated points.",
    "example": [
        "a(5)=3: there are two possibilities to cut 5, i.e. (1,4) and (2,3); (1,4) gives two possibility to draw such a graph because 4 has also two way of cutting: (2,2) and (1,4); (2,3) gives one possibility; and 2+1=3"
