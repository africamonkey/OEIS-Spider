        "The greedy algorithm means iteration of A261424 until a palindrome is reached. For 2 < n < 20 at least, the sequence seems to grow according to a(n+1) = a(n)+1+10^(length(a(n))*2-3) = a(n)+1+10^(2^(n-1)+1): We have a(7) <= 10^17+1000101025, a(8) <= 10^33+10^17+1000101026, a(9) <= 10^65+10^33+10^17+1000101027, a(10) <= 10^129+10^65+10^33+10^17+1000101028, etc, with conjectured equality. - _M.
