    "comment": [
        "We start with two strings, of length n, that are the identity permutation of alphabet letters. The space between two adjacent letters is called a breakpoint. We then apply duplications, which take a substring from one string and insert it into the center of the other string. Each duplication uses three breakpoints; two for the substring and one for its destination. Each breakpoint can only be used once. This alternating duplications pattern produces a word T. The formula for the longest possible T uses the length of each string (n)."
