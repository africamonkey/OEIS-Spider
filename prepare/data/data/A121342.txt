        "Larger terms of this sequence were calculated by _Giovanni Resta_ and _Farideh Firoozbakht_. This sequence is a subsequence of A083360 (Subsequence of sequence A083359 in which factors do not overlap in the number), which is a subsequence of A083359 (Visible Factor Numbers, or VPNs: numbers n with the property that every prime factor of n can be found in the decimal expansion of n and every digit of n can be found in a prime factor. No additional 0's and 1's are allowed). Also, this sequence is a subsequence of A096595 (Numbers n with the property that n is an anagram of the digits of the distinct prime factors of n)."
