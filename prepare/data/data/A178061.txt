    "comment": [
        "Cycles have at least 2 edges, and the multigraph has no loops. For this sequence, a pair p,q of cycles is equivalent if the edge-sequence of q can be formed by rotating and possibly reversing the edge sequence of p. Note that this definition ignores the starting vertex of a loop, which halves the number of distinct cycles of length >2."
