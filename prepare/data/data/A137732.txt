        "Consider a set of n unlabeled elements. Form all splittings into two subsets. Consider the resulting sets and perform the splittings on all their subsets and so on. In order to understand this structure, imagine that each of the two parts can be put either 'to the left or to the right.",
        "E.g., (4) gives (3,1) and (1,3). That is, the order of parts counts. H(n+1) = number of splittings of the n-set {*,*,...,*} composed of n elements '*'. E.g., H(4)=5 because we have (***), (**,*), (*,**), ((*,*),*), (*,(*,*)).",
        "Equivalently, we have (3), (2,1), (1,2), ((1,1),1), (1,(1,1)). The case for labeled elements is described by A137731. This structure is related to the Double Factorials A000142 for which the recurrence is a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n-1} binomial(n-1,k)*a(k)*a(n-k), with a(1)=1, a(2)=1.",
