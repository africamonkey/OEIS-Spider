        "Numbers whose digits are permutations of (1,2,3,4,...,n) for some n>=1, for which the 3 first primes (2,3,5) does not appear in their factorization. This constitute the smallest subset of A030299 for which it's possible to synthesize a compact formula to express the generic term: it contains every prime number already in A030299.",
