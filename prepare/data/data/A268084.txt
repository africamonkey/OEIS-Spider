        "A binary word is a sequence each member of which belongs to an alphabet of size 2 such as {a,b}. An abelian square is an even length factor whose first half is an anagram of the second half, for example abaaaaab.",
        "One can also ask for the minimum number of distinct abelian squares in a word of length n and the minimum number of nonequivalent abelian squares. Two abelian squares are equivalent if they are anagrams of each other.",
        "For example the word ababbaaabaa contains 5 distinct abelian squares, aa, bb, abab, abba and baaaba, but only 4 nonequivalent abelian squares since abab and abba are equivalent. It's conjectured that both the minimum number of distinct abelian squares in a binary word of length n and the minimum number of nonequivalent abelian squares equal floor(n/4)"
