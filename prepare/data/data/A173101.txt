        "{A109776 INTERSECTION A001358}. a(n) = n-th integer k such that OMEGA(k)=2 where OMEGA(n) is the sum of the exponents in the prime decomposition of k, and reading the number (in base 10) in successive pairs of digits gives a (possibly redundant) description of the number."

    "example": [
        "a(1) = 22 because \"22\" does indeed consist of \"two 2's\" and 22 = 2 * 11 is semiprime. a(4) = 10213223 because 10213223 consists of one \"0\", two 1's, three 2's, and two 3's; and 10213223 = 41 * 249103 is semiprime."
