        "A.   The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [RED ; NEUTRAL ; BLUE], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the sequence is optimal (the sequence presented gives the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle for the given pre-coloring configuration). Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",

        "D.   Number of moves of disk k, for large k, is close to (8/11)*3^(k-1) ~ 0.727*3^(k-1). Series designation: P727(k)."
