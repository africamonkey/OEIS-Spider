        "The middle binary digit of those positive integers with an odd number of binary digits can be considered to either be on both the left and the right side of the number, or to be on neither side. In other words, the middle binary digit can be ignored.",
        "We could instead count the number of 0's in both halves of the binary representations. If the number of 0's is the same for both halves of the binary representation of n, then n is in this sequence.",

        "46 in binary is 101110. Splitting the binary representation down the middle, we have (101)(110). Since there are exactly the same number (two) of 1's in both halves, then 46 is in this sequence."
