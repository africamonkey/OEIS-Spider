    "comment": [
        "By skipping least power of 2, the numbers in sequence A033875 jump up rapidly and leaves most of the primes behind. The first skipped prime is 29 but it joins the sequence by 29+2^1=31. So do 37. Then comes 53, it makes the second sequence in this row to an enormous number. Thereafter 67 goes back to the original sequence at 241. The next candidate sequence head is 127, which is in A102636"
