        "This sequence is part of the two dimensional array of sequences based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.",
        "For further motivation and cross-references, see sequence A235265 which is the main entry for this whole family of sequences.",
        "Seems to be a subsequence of A066649 and A123364.",
        "Since the trailing digit of the base 7 expansion must (like all others) be less than 3, this is a subsequence of A045381."
