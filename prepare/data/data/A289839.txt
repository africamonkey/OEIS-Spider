        "The first 14 terms correspond to n from 0 to 13, which makes 8*n^2+8*n+31 a prime-generating polynomial (see the link).",
        "This is a prime-generating polynomial of the form c*n^2+c*n+p, where c=2^k (k=0,1,2...) and p is prime with c and p containing at most two digits. Prime-generating polynomials of this kind arise for k=0,1,2,3 - see A005846 and A007635 (k=0), A007639 (k=1), and A048988 (k=2).",
        "All terms are of the form 4m+3. Terms 1 and 4 are Mersenne primes (A000668)."
