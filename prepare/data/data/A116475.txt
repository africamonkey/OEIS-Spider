    "comment": [
        "Since the 1-division is distinct and consistent in the 1-limit, the sequence starts there. From a purely musical point of view one might prefer to begin the sequence at 3. - _Gene Ward Smith_, Mar 29 2006"

    "example": [
        "9-EDO is consistent and distinct through the 5 limit because 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5 and 5/3 map to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 steps respectively and all the compositions of those intervals are consistent."
