        "Belabas invented an algorithm to identify all cubic fields with a discriminant bounded by X in essentially linear time, and computed the above values up to a(11).",
        "The number of real cubic fields with discriminant <= X is asymptotic to X/(12*zeta(3)) = (0.069325...)*X. The second order term was conjectured by Roberts to be a known constant times X^{5/6}, and this was subsequently proved by Bhargava et al."
