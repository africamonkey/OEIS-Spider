        "Gravin's abstract: Let c => 2 and p => c be two integers. We will call a proper coloring of the graph G a (c,p)-nondegenerate, if for any vertex of G with degree at least p there are at least c vertices of different colors adjacent to it. In our work we prove the following result, which generalizes Brook's Theorem. Let D => 3 and G be a graph without cliques on D+1 vertices and the degree of any vertex in this graph is not greater than D. Then for every integer c => 2 there is a proper (c,p)-nondegenerate vertex D-coloring of G, where p=(c^3+8c^2+19c+6)(c+1). During the primary proof, some interesting corollaries are derived."
