        "This sequence appears to its author to be part of a large coincidental feature of base 10 whose discovery began with A095694.",
        "A227950 gives the digit lengths for this sequence and A227951 gives the number of consecutive values strung together. Combining these may help in the discovery of larger, as yet unknown, terms of this sequence (See FORMULA)."

        "Since the concatenation of 10 and 9 produces the prime 109, the number 109 is in the sequence.",
