        "On Feb 27 2012 Zhi-Wei Sun conjectured that a(n) is a prime with the only exception a(5)=10, and that a(n) does not exceed n^2/2 for all n=2,3,4,... He also conjectured that max{n>0: 1!,...,n! are pairwise incongruent mod p} is asymptotically equivalent to sqrt(p), where p is an odd prime.",
        "He guessed that if we replace k! in the definition of a(n) by (-1)^k*k! then a(n) is a prime with the only exception a(3)=6. If we replace k! in the definition of a(n) by (2k)! or (-1)^k*(2k)!, then Zhi-Wei Sun conjectured that a(n) will take only prime values.",
