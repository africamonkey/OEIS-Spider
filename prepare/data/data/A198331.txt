        "A198329(n) is the Matula-Goebel number of the rooted  tree obtained by removing from the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n the vertices of degree one, together with their incident edges. If the repeated application of this pruning operation will lead to the Matula-Goebel number 2 (corresponding to the 1-edge tree), then the starting rooted tree is central. The Maple program is based on this."
