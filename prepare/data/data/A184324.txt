C(k+1, k)=1 because K_{k+1} is connected and the unique k-regular graph on k+1 vertices. For k > 1, since D(k+3,k)=0, then C(k+3,k) = E(k+3,k) = E(k+3,2) = A008483(k + 3). Also, for k >0, since D(k+2,k)=0, then C(k+2,k) = E(k+2,k) = E(k+2,1) = (k+1) mod 2. With the examples below and A165652(n)=0 for n < 6 = offset, QED."
