        "Also equals sum of squares of the coefficients of the (numerators of) the G.F. for the count of monomials in the Schur polynomials of degree n (all partitions of weight n), in function of the number of variables v. - _Wouter Meeussen_, Dec 27 2010",
        "Studied by Carlitz, Roselle, and Scoville in 'Permutations and Sequences with Repetitions by Number of Increases'. They refer to a rise/ascent as a 'jump', and consider the first entry of a permutation to always be a jump, so #jumps=#rises+1. Similarly, the number of rises in the inverse permutation/number of inverse descents corresponds to what they call the 'number of readings', and follow a convention so that #rises in inverse permutation+1=#readings. Formula can be attained by R_m(k,r), setting t=k, and summing k from 1 to m+1. - _Kevin Dilks_, Jun 09 2015"
