        "a(n) is the number of ordered pairs (a,b) of length n binary sequences such that a and b are equivalent by rotational symmetry. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Dec 31 2011",
        "a(n) is the weighted sum of binary strings of length n by their number of distinct images by rotation. There is a natural correspondence between the first 2^(n-1) sequences (starting by a 0) and the 2^(n-1) starting with a 1 by inversion. There is also an internal correspondance by order inversion. - _Olivier G\u00e9rard_, Jan 01 2011",
