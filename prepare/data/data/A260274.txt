Repeat the same process for all the different digits, in ascending order, in n. Sequence lists the fixed points of this transform.",
    "comment": [
        "If x is in the sequence, then the digit reversal of x also belongs to the sequence.",
        "If we consider the numbers that under this transform produce a multiple of the number itself, for n <= 10^8 we should add only 153363. Digit 1 is in position 6, 3 in position 1, 3 and 4, 5 in position 5, 6 in position 2. Finally, 613452 / 153363 = 4."
