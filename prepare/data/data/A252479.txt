    "comment": [
        "A000219 counts planar partitions of n, which are represented by arrays of positive integers A(r,c) that sum to n and are 2-way monotonic in the sense of A(r,c+1) <= A(r,c) and A(r+1,c) <= A(r,c). The sequence here imposes the additional constraint that the absolute difference between A(r,c) and any of the (up to 4) adjacent terms A(r+1,c), A(r-1,c), A(r,c+1) and A(r,c-1) is <=1."
