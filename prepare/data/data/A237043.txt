        "If p^2 divides 2^n - 1 for some odd prime p, then by definition the multiplicative order of 2 mod p^2 divides n. The multiplicative order of 2 mod p^2 is p times the multiplicative order of 2 mod p unless p is a Wieferich prime, in which case the two orders are identical. Hence either p is a Wieferich prime or p*log_2(p+1) <= n. This should allow finding larger members of this sequence. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 04 2014",
