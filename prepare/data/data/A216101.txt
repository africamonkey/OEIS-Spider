        "The harmonic mean of N numbers p1,p2,..,pN is the number H whose reciprocal is the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of p1,p2,..,pN; that is to say, 1/H = ((1/p1)+(1/p2)+..+(1/pN))/N.",
        "So, for two quantities p1 and p2, their harmonic mean may be written as H=(2*p1*p2)/(p1+p2).",
        "The harmonic mean (sometimes called the subcontrary mean) is one of several kinds of average. Typically, it is appropriate for situations when the average of rates is desired."
