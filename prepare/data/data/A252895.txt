        "Open lockers in the locker problem where the student numbers are the set of perfect squares.",
        "The locker problem is a classic mathematical problem. Imagine a row containing an infinite number of lockers numbered from one to infinity. Also imagine an infinite number of students numbered from one to infinity. All of the lockers begin closed. The first student opens every locker that is a multiple of one, which is every locker. The second student closes every locker that is a multiple of two, so all of the even-numbered lockers are closed. The third student opens or closes every locker that is a multiple of three. This process continues for all of the students.",
        "A variant on the locker problem is when not all student numbers are considered; in the case of this sequence, only the square-numbered students open and close lockers. The sequence here is a list of the open lockers after all of the students have gone.",
        "n is in the sequence if and only if it is the product of a squarefree number (A005117) and a fourth power (A000583). - _Robert Israel_, Apr 07 2015",
        "Let D be the multiset containing d0(k), the divisor counting function, for each divisor k of n. n is in the sequence if and only if D admits a partition into two parts A and B such that the sum of the elements of A is exactly one more or less than the sum of the elements of B. For example, if n = 80, we have D = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10}, and A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 8} and B = {2, 5, 6, 10}. The sum of A is 22, and the sum of B is 23. - _Griffin N. Macris_, Oct 10 2016"
