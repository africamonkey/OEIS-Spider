        "The number of free polyominoes of size 4n that have 90 degree rotational symmetry about a point that coincides with the corner of a square, independently of any other symmetries. Note that for polyominoes which have a hole in the center, the center of rotation will be the corner of a square within the hole, rather than being the corner of a square of the polyomino itself. The sequence is defined for 4n rather than n as polyominoes of size not multiple of 4 cannot have the required symmetry."
