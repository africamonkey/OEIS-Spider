    "comment": [
        "The condition x^2 + y^2 = x*10^k + y is equivalent to (2x-10^k)^2 + (2y-1)^2 = 10^2k + 1, so to find these sequence elements it is necessary to write 10^2k + 1 as the sum of two squares.",
        "The number of elements in this sequence corresponding to a fixed k is tau(10^2k + 1) - 1, where tau counts the (positive) divisors of a natural number. For all k, 10^2k + 1 is itself a member of the sequence corresponding to k, and is the only one such if it is prime. The elements themselves are arranged according to magnitude, indexed here by n. There is some disruption of the order of the terms versus the corresponding exponent k. For example, the twelfth member of the sequence, 100010000, corresponds to k=6, yet the thirteenth, 1765038125, corresponds to the smaller k=5.",
