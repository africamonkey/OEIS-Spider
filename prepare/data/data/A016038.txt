        "All elements of the sequence greater than 6 are prime (ab = a(b-1) + a or a^2 = (a-1)^2 + 2(a-1) + 1). Mersenne and Fermat primes are not in the sequence.",
        "Additional comments: if you can factor a number as a*b then it is a palindrome in base b-1, where b is the larger of the two factors. (If the number is a square, then it can be a palindrome in an additional way, in base (sqrt(n)-1)). The ab form does not work when a = b-1, but of course there are no two consecutive primes (other than 2,3, which explains the early special cases), so if you can factor a number as a(a-1), then another factorization also exists). - Michael B Greenwald (mbgreen(AT)central.cis.upenn.edu), Jan 01 2002",
        "Note that no prime p is palindromic in base b for the range sqrt(p) < b < p-1. Hence to find non-palindromic primes, we need only examine bases up to floor(sqrt(p)), which greatly reduces the computational effort required. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 01 2008",
        "No number n is palindromic in any base b with n/2 <= b <= n-2, so this is also numbers not palindromic in any base b with 2 <= b <= n/2.",
        "Sequence A047811 (this sequence without 0, 1, 2, 3) is mentioned in the Guy paper, in which he reports on unsolved problems. This problem came from Mario Borelli and Cecil B. Mast. The paper poses two questions about these numbers: (1) Can palindromic or nonpalindromic primes be otherwise characterized? and (2) What is the cardinality, or the density, of the set of palindromic primes? Of the set of nonpalindromic primes? - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 18 2011",
