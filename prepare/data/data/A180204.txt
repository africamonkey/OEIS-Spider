        "A006995 is a subset of this sequence, because a palindrome plus its reverse is equivalent to itself times 2, which in base 2 is expressed by adding a zero onto the end of the number. this zero is eliminated by the second reversal, leaving the reverse of the original number, which, since its a palindrome, is the equivalent of the number itself, and 2x-x=x."
