    "comment": [
        "The abelian sandpile growth model starts with height h on every site of the square grid.",
        "An addition increases the height of the origin by 1. After each addition, the model is stabilized by toppling unstable sites.",
        "A site is unstable if its height is at least 4; in a toppling, its height decreases by 4 and the height of its neighbors increases by 1.",
        "If h=2, then for any number of additions, the set of sites that toppled at least once is a square. This was proved in Fey-Redig-2008.",
        "For all n, a(n) <= (2n+3)^2. In Fey-Levine-Peres-2010, it was proved that for n large enough, a(n) >= Pi/4 n^2."

        "After 4 more additions, the origin topples again. Then more sites become unstable, so that the set of sites that toppled at least once becomes the square with radius 1. Therefore a(1) = 6."
