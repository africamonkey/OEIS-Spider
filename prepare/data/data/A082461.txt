    "comment": [
        "Of course any number m can be written as m = a_1, but this trivial construction is excluded.",
        "A palindromic number of four digits has the form abba, where a is in {1, 2, ..., 9} and b is in {0, 1, 2, ..., 9}. There are 9x10=90 possibilities. For example, 1551 or 2002, but not 3753. However, 3753 = 3(75)3 and 4646 = (46)(46) are terms of the present sequence. The 4-digit numbers in the present sequence therefore have the form ABA, where A is in {1, 2, ..., 9} and B is in {00, 01, 02, 03, ..., 99} \\ {00, 11, 22, 33, ..., 99}; or CC, where C is in {10, 11, 12, ..., 99} \\ {11, 22, 33, ..., 99}. In the first case there are 9x(100-10)=9x90=810 terms. In the second case, 90-9=81. Total: 810+81=891 4-digit non-palindromic terms."
