        "Riesel showed that there are an infinite number of integers such that k*(2^n) - 1 is not prime for any integer n. He showed that the number 509203 has this property, as does 509203 plus any positive integer multiple of 11184810.",
        "In this sequence, lesser of (provable) Sierpinski pairs appears with the linear formula a(n) = 7523267 + 11184810*(n-1).",
        "Since 7523267 is a member of A244561, for every integer k > 0, 7523267*2^k+1 has a divisor in the set {3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}. Because of the 11184810 = 2*3*5*7*13*17*241, a(n)*2^k+1 = 7523267*2^k+1 + 11184810*(n-1)*2^k+1 has always a divisor in the set {3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}. Since a(n) is always odd because of the definition of it, a(n) is a Sierpi\u0144ski number. Additionally, 7523267 + 14 = 7523281 is also member of A244561. So a(n) + 14 is a Sierpi\u0144ski number too, with same proof.",
        "In conclusion if minimum difference between consecutive (provable) Sierpi\u0144ski numbers is 14 (See comment section of A270971 for the reason behind this claim), a(n) and a(n) + 14 must be consecutive and a(n) = 7523267 + 11184810*(n-1) is the formula of this sequence."
