    "comment": [
        "Technically, the formula is undefined modulo 2# or 3#, but I have listed their values as \"0\", since there are no 8's in the first differences of their reduced residue systems. For our purposes, by \"8's\", we mean n such that n,n+8 are relatively prime to the primorial modulus, while n+1,n+2,n+3,n+4,n+5,n+6,n+7 all share a factor (or factors) with p#."
