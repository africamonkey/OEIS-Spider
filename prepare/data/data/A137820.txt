        "The sequence lists indices n for which A002375(n) / n is less than for all previous indices n>2, or equivalently, assuming that A002375(n)>0 for all n>2 (Goldbach conjecture), values for which n / A002375(n) is greater than for all previous indices n>2.",
        "We do not consider indices n=1 and n=2, for which the sequence A002375(n) (= number of prime {p,q} such that 2n=p+q) is zero.",
        "Note also that A045917=A002375 except for n=2; since we exclude n<3, one can equivalently replace one of these two by the other in the definition.",
        "In A002375, an upper bound for A002375(n) is given ; however, the Goldbach conjecture is: A002375(n)>0 for all n>2, thus rather connected to the question of a lower bound. This sequence lists values of n for which A002375(n) is particularly low.",
        "If the conjecture is wrong, then this sequence A137820 is finite: It will end with the counter-example n such that A002375(n)=0, i.e. 2n cannot be written as the sum of 2 primes."
