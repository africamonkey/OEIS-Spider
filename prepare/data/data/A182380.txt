        "Let w be any phrase (e.g., w could be Homer's Iliad, or w could be the unabridged concatenation of all of Shakespeare's works). Then Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions implies that if the last letter of w is relatively prime to 26, then there are infinitely many primes whose final digits base 26 are exactly w.  There is no guarantee, however, that these primes would be prime phrases since there is essentially no control over how the beginnings of these base 26 representations would look."
