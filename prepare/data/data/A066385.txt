        "In a problem in the \"Bundeswettbewerb 2002\" competition there are 12 sticks of lengths 1,..,12 put in a ring in random order. It has to be proved that there are at least 3 consecutive sticks with total length not less than 20. A closer look shows that the total length is at least a(12)=21. The problem of the contest is a consequence of the following observation: every term a(n) is at least ceil(3*(n+1)/2), since n*a(n) >= sum{i=1..n}(p(i-1)+p(i)+p(i+1)) = 3*sum{i=1..n}(i) =3*n*(n+1)/2. So in the case n=12 we have (total length) >= a(12)=21 >= 20.",
