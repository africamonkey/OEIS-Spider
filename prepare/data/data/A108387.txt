    "comment": [
        "By my definition of (a nontrivial) transmutable prime, each digit of each term must be capable of being an ending digit of a prime, so this sequence is a subsequence of A108387, primes p such that p's set of distinct digits is {1,3,7,9}. The repunit primes (A004022), which would otherwise trivially be (doubly-)transmutable and primes whose distinct digits are other proper subsets of {1,3,7,9} are excluded here by the two-disjoint-pair condition."
