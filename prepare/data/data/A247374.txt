        "This type of lock is quite common in the real world. The lock has typically 13 'number' buttons (actually 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X Y Z), plus a C (for clear) button, and a knob to turn to 'try' the combination. The way it functions is that the unlocking code is an n-digit binary number. By pressing one of the number buttons, you change the corresponding digit from 0 to 1. Pressing C reverts all digits to 0."
