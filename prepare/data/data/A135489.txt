        "A game is a sequence of valid scores (positive values for the home team, negative values for the visiting team). The valid scores for basketball played during the years 1896-1967 are {1, 2, -1, -2}. A tie-less game is one in which the teams are never in a tie (except at the beginning, when no team has scored yet)."
