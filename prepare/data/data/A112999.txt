        "a(2) is prime. a(4) is prime, as pointed out by Poo Sung on Prime Curios for 331997. a(3), a(5) and a(11) are semiprime. a(6), a(7), a(8) and a(10) have 3 prime factors. a(9) has 7 prime factors. a(12) has at least 4 prime factors. From a(4) onwards, all terms are congruent to 31997 mod 10^5. From a(5) onwards, all terms are congruent to 531997 mod 10^6. From a(5) onwards, all terms are congruent to 7531997 mod 10^7. The number of digits of a(n) for n = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12 are 1, 1, 3, 6, 11, 18, 26, 37, 51, 84, 105."
