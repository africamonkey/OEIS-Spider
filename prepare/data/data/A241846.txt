        "Let d_1 d_2... d_q denote the decimal expansion of a number n. The sequence lists the numbers n such that (d_1 + d_2 +...+ d_q)^3 = (d_1 * d_2 *...* d_q)^2.",
        "The sequence is finite and contains 1419 terms because the maximum sum of the digits of a(n) is 16, the maximum product of the digits is 64 with 16^3 = 64^2 and the greatest number of the sequence is 2222221111.",
        "The primitive values of a(n) (numbers whose decimal digits are not a permutation of another number of the sequence) are 0, 1, 88, 333, 11248, 112228, 1111444, 11112244, 111122224, 1111222222.",
        "Nevertheless, the numbers 112228, 1111444, 11112244, 111122224, 1111222222 are not completely independent; for example, a decimal digit 4 of 1111444 becomes 22 and gives the number 11112244."
