        "n*(n+2) + 1 = n^2 + 2*n + 1 = (n+1)^2. Since we know that n mod 4 = 0, then n+1 cannot be of the form 2*k^2, that is, c and d must be different. So (n+1)^2 is the sum of two nonzero squares because n+1 = c^2 + d^2.",
        "n*(n+2) + 2 = (n+1)^2 + 1, that is obviously the sum of two nonzero squares.",
        "So if n is in this sequence, then n*(n+2), n*(n+2) + 1 and n*(n+2) + 2 are the sums of two nonzero squares, that is n*(n+2) must also be member of this sequence.",
