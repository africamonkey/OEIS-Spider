        "Comments from _Hugo van der Sanden_, Oct 30 2007 and Oct 31 2007: (Start) Almost all the entries are of the form 2p or 2pq where q = 2p +/- 1 (and so p is in A005383 or A005384). The exceptions are: 8 18 24 40 56 60 72 84 132 156 210 220 380 ... with no others up to 2e6, suggesting that this exception list is finite and complete.",
        "See also my comments on A134320. For the present sequence, we see that elements cannot be perfect squares since those have an odd number of divisors.",
        "Thus they must either be oblong numbers with one isolated divisor below the square root (such as the isolated 5 for 110) or non-oblong numbers with all divisors below the square root being non-isolated.",
        "I expect that proving this sequence consists only of the two general classes and the finite, complete list of exceptions describe above is also possible and would use a similar approach to the first case. (End)"
