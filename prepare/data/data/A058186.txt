        "To represent a number in base b, if a digit exceeds b, subtract b and carry 1. In fractional base b/c, subtract b and carry c. The sequence consists of numbers which in base 5 have digits in {0,2,4} except that the unit digit can be any from {0,1,2,3,4}."

    "example": [
        "20 (10 in decimal) appears since it is written as 20 both in base 5 and base 10/2. 30 (15 in decimal) does not since it is written as 30 in base 5 and 25 in base 10/2."
