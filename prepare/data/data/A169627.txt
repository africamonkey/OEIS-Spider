        "The Carr and Carr article says: \"Pryor (1954) has postulated three developmental series of bud numbers, as follows : (a) 1, 3, 7, 11, 15, 23, 35 ... (b) 1, 3, 7, 13, 21, 31 ...; (c) 1, 3, 15, 31, 63, 127 ...\"",
        "It would be nice to have more information.",
        "The given terms (corresponding to (b) above) would match the formula a(n)=n^2+n+1, as suggested (with offset corrected) on the Weidmann's web page, cf. LINKS. This would mean that a(n) = A002061(n+1). But based on the construction and illustration in the Pryor paper, it could as well be a duplicate of A161206. The first terms also coincide with the Treillis sequence A115298. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 14 2015"
