        "Prefaced with a 1: (1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 51, ...), convolved with A006789 = A006789; identical to reversing k terms of one sequence then taking the dot product of k terms of the other: e.g., A006789(6) = 143 = (51, 15, 5, 2, 1, 1) dot (1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 43) = (51 + 15 + 10 + 10 + 14 + 43). Equals row sums of triangle A153199. A153197 can be generated from the Hankel transform [1,1,1,...] by taking successive iterates of the operations: (binomial transform of [1,1,1,...]) followed by INVERT transform of the result, then binomial transform of the result, (repeat cycle)...; until the operations converge upon a two sequence fixed limit cycle of A006789 and A153197. Or, the infinite set of operations Q may begin: INVERT transform of [1,1,1,..] followed by binomial transform of the result, INVERT transform of the result, etc; until the operations again converge upon A006789 and A153197. The two sequences A006789 and A153197 have the mutual relationships that binomial transform of A006789 = A153197; while the INVERT transform of A153197 prefaced with a 1 and then prefaced with a 1 afterward = A006789.",
        "Product of the two sequences (A153197 prefaced with a 1) and A006789 = A006789 with offset 1. Or, (1,1,2,5,15,51,...) * (1,1,2,5,14,43,...) = (1,2,5,14,43,...).",
        "Conjecture: Given any sequence with Hankel transform of [1,1,1,...], performing alternate operations: binomial transform followed by INVERT transform, then binomial transform of the last result (repeat); or INVERT transform starting first, will converge upon A006789 and A153197 as a two sequence limit cycle. The conjecture can be extended to any Hankel transform (and their accompanying sequence set): analogous operations will converge upon a Bessel-type sequence and its binomial transform."
