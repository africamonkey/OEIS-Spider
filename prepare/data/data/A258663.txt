        "It is my conjecture that the integer formed by the repeating digits in the decimal fraction a(n)/(a(n)*9-1) is the smallest integer such that rotating the digits to the left produces a number which is ((a(n)+1)/a(n)) times larger.",
        "Example: a(n) = 2: 2/17 = 0.1176470588235294... repeating with a cycle of 16.",
        "1176470588235294 x (3/2) = 1764705882352941, which is 1176470588235294 rotated to the left.",
        "An additional conjecture is that the values x in this sequence are the only values where rotating an integer one to the left produces a value (x+1)/x times as large. For example, the conjecture is that there are integers i that when rotated one to the left produce the value 3i/2, 7i/6 and 9i/8, but none that produce the value 2i/1, 4i/3, 5i/4, 6i/5 or 8i/7.",

        "The second conjecture is false. For example, 225806451612903*(8/7) = 258064516129032, or 45 * (6/5) = 54 or 230769*(4/3)=307692. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jul 28 2015"
