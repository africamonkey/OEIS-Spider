        "These are, for each digit d and each natural number k, the smallest positive number in which the digit d appears k (or more) times, in numerical order. They are all numbers with all digits repeated except numbers of the form 10^m.",
        "If we started with 0 the term 10 would be missed and all other terms would be the same."

        "100 is included because no previous term contains two 0's. 111 is included because no previous term contains more than 2 1's. Every number between 101 and 110 inclusive is omitted because each contains at most 2 1's (no more than 11) and at most 1 of any other digit (no more than 2 thru 10)."
