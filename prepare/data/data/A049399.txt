        "In the set of all positive differences of the sequence each integer appears exactly twice, i.e., lambda = 2.",
        "One could try to greedily build such a difference set as follows: b(1) = 1, b(n+1) = b(n)+j with j the smallest difference yet to appear twice. This would begin with {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 17, 23, 31, 39, 49} and fail; the smallest difference yet to appear twice is then 12 = 17-5, but 49+12 = 61 and 61-39 = 22 = 23-1 = 39-17. - _Danny Rorabaugh_, Sep 27 2015"
