        "Conjecture: sequences for 2-ads, 3-ads (composites of 3 primes), 4-ads, etc., converge to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8,..., respectively."

    "example": [
        "Example: For the second ratio, 4*6 is the denominator (product of first two semiprimes), and there 8 multiples of the semiprimes 4,6 in the interval, including those two semiprimes, repetitions (such as 4*3, 2*6) are only counted once. The ratio is then 8/24. The first few analogous ratios for 3-ads are: 1/8, 16/96, 336/1728, 7296/34560,..."
