In that range, all 2160 odd multiples 1, 3, 5, ..., 4319*41 occur, but only 55 even multiples, with a(34) = 66*41 = 2706 being the first one of them. The multipliers for even terms in that range seems to be given by 66*A047253(1..55) from 66*1 up to 66*A047253(55) = 66*65 = 4290. (Where A047253 gives the numbers not divisible by six)."
