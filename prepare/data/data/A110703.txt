        "In other words, numbers n such that a list of consecutive numbers can be split into two parts in which their sums both equal n. - _A. D. Skovgaard_, May 22 2017",
        "If the two runs overlap in one number, the runs are Friends and their sums are A110701. The sums are the difference of two triangular numbers A000217.",

        "a(n) seems to always be divisible by 3.- _A. D. Skovgaard_, May 22 2017. This is true. Sequence lists values of n = t(t+1)/2 - k(k+1)/2 = m(m+1)/2 - t(t+1)/2 with k < t < m. Since any triangular number must be of the form 3w or 3w+1, then there are two possibilities for n = 3w - k(k+1)/2 = m(m+1)/2 - 3w or n = 3w + 1 - k(k+1)/2 = m(m+1)/2 - 3w - 1. For first case, if k(k+1)/2 = 3u+1, there is no solution for m. Similarly for second case, if k(k+1)/2 = 3u, there is no solution for m. So always n must be divisible by 3. - _Altug Alkan_, May 22 2017"
