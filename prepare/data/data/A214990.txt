        "Let {x} denote the fractional part of x.  The second nearest integer to x, denoted by s(x), is defined to be ceiling(x) if {x} < 1/2 and floor(x) if {x} >= 1/2.  If x is not an integer, there are exactly two integers k such that |k-x|<1; one is round(x) = floor(x+1/2), and the other is s(x).",
