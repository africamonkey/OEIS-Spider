        "Subsequence of A006489, A141279 and A141280. Each term is congruent to 1 or 10 mod 11 so for no prime p can this pattern be extended also to include primes p-6^5 and p+6^5 (one of them is divisible by 11). See A070392 for residues mod 11 of powers of 6. As each term of A006489 greater than 11 is congruent to 3 or 7 mod 10, combining results gives that a(n) is congruent to 23, 43, 67, or 87 mod 110."
