        "This sequence is ill-defined from the 2nd term on. Proof: Assume that x is the term following the initial 0. Then the number x*10^(6n), for n sufficiently large, is spelled out: name(x) name(10^(6n)). This comes after name(x) in lexicographical order, and thus before x in this sequence. [From _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 20 2009]"
