        "All proper powers of any number greater than 1 (A001597(n), n>1) are a subset of this sequence. On the other hand, this is a subset of A067340 which admits also numbers k for which bigomega(k) = omega(k). In particular, prime numbers are excluded.",
        "The density of these numbers, i.e., the ratio n/a(n), apparently decreases with n, reaching 0.04420... for n = 10000000. Conjecture: n/a(n) might have a nonzero limit below 0.0427 (the density found in the interval 9500000 < n <= 10000000)."
