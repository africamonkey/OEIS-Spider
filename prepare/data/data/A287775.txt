        "CLAIM: d(n) = A108103(n+1) for n=1,2,\u2026.",
        "Proof: As a word A287772 = 100110010011001100100110010011... obtained by substituting 0->1, 1->00 in the Fibonacci word F=0100101001001010010100...",
        "This implies that A287772 is a concatenation of 00\u2019s separated by 1\u2019s and 11\u2019s. Moreover, a 0110 occurs iff 1001 occurs in F, and a 010 occurs iff 101 occurs in F. Note also that occurrence of a 00 in A287772 yields a d(n)=1 (and so every other letter in d is a 1), occurrence of a 010 yields a d(n)=2, and occurrence of a 0110 yields a d(n)=3. Since the 1001\u2019s and 101\u2019s occur in 1F according to F itself with 1 prepended (see A001468 and A282162), we must have d(n)=A108103(n+1). (End)"
