        "a(n) is equal to n^2 + 1 with predictable regularity; in particular, the values of n for which a(n) does not equal n^2 + 1 are exactly those values n for which 3n is divisible by A269347(3*m) for some m with 1 < m < n. This is in part because 1 + sum{i=1...n}(2i - 1) = n^2 + 1; when computing a(n), each term has this form except when the named condition holds.",
