        "This sequence is a subsequence of A122786. In fact the terms are composite terms n of A122786 such that gcd(n,3)=1. Theorem: If both numbers q & 2q-1 are primes greater than 3 and n=q*(2q-1) then 9^(n-1)==1 (mod n) (n is in the sequence). So for n>2 A005382(n)* (2*A005382(n)-1) is in the sequence; 91,703,1891,2701,12403,18721,... is the related subsequence. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Sep 15 2006",
