        "Since the formula is being applied twice (once with -3 and once with +3) to each prime generated, each prime may have at most two \"children\". So if p=2, then its children are 10*2-3 = 17 and 10*2+3 = 23. When p=167 there is but one child 10*167-3=1667 because 10*167+3=1673 which is (7 * 239) and therefore not a prime. Essentially a tree of primes is being built which is at best binary:",

        "The 10p+/-3 tree for the root prime 2 is 8 generations deep and has a population of 28 nodes (including 2 itself).",
        "The choice of 2 as the root of this tree, 10 as the coefficient and 3 as the +/-offset are not arbitrary. Performing this analysis for the first 1,000 primes for all combinations of coefficient (2 to 32) and offset (1 to 31), demonstrates that only 6p+/-5 (see A086321) and 10p+/-3 ever produce a tree with this many nodes on it. All other prime trees are smaller. 4p+/-3 produces a 25 node tree when p=2, 12p+/-5 produces a 22 node tree when p=2 and 28p+/-15 and 30p+/-7 produce 21 node trees when p=953 and 13 respectively.",
        "Note that the most populous tree formed need not be the deepest, since a single generation can produce 1 or 2 children for each parent. The deepest tree is 4p+/-3 which is 11 generations deep when p=2.",
