    "comment": [
        "There are 3 lexicographically earlier sequences with this property, but they all stop at some point. The first one is A276514, starting with 5,10,15,25,31,... and halting with a(49) = 300. The second one starts with 9,10,19,29,31,... and stops with a(246) = 3003. The third one starts with 10,11,13,15,17,... and stops with a(8) = 22, as shown here: 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22 [to compute an hypothetical a(9) one has to add to 22 the second digit of the sequence (which is zero) and (again) the second digit of the sequence (which is also zero): 22+0+0 = 22.",
        "As this sequence, starting with 11, 13, 15, 17, 19..., shows no zero digit among it's first 10 digits, it will never stop."
