    "comment": [
        "Trivial cases are identified as those values of n where the digits are already in descending order, like 3210 or 8222, such that DSort(n)=n. In such cases DSort(n)/n is equivalent to n/n (as in 3210/3210).",
        "a(1) and a(2) are primitive. Clearly if DSort(n) mod n = 0, then dsort(n x 10) mod (n x 10) = 0. Therefore since 1750842 is a member, so will be 17508420, 175084200, 1750842000 and so on. The nonprimitive member 19750842 sets up the implication that 1(9...)750842 is a member. A quick test of 199750842, 1999750842 and 19999750842 seems to confirm this."

        "a(1)=1750842 because the digits of 1750842 in descending order are 8754210 which is divisible by 1750842. a(24)=3105 because the digits of 3105 in ascending order are 135 and 3105 is divisible by 135."
