    "comment": [
        "Most elements of the sequence have k = 1, only 132 and 16371 with k=3 are found. Further searches did not find any more elements with k >= 3. k has to be odd in any case, this can be easily seen by looking at the parity of the prime factors. Perhaps someone with a stronger computer can find more numbers with k>1, if there are any."
