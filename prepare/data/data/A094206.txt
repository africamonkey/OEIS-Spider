        "Take a set of objects [n] indexed by the positive integers which multiply so that [a] [b] = [ab] (which automatically makes them commute, associate, obey gcd([a],[b])=[gcd(a,b)] etc.) and also partially define a consistent ordering relation < to obey two rules:",
        "Rule 1: p<q ==> [p] < [q], for primes p,q and Rule 2: A<B, C<D ==> AC < BD, for any objects A, B, C, D. Rule 2 captures certain intuitive requirements for ordering products - for example specializing A=[1] and C=D captures the idea that \"multiples are larger\", etc. Sequence gives number of ways of consistently ordering [1]..[n]."

    "example": [
        "Up to n=3 there's only one way: [1], [1][2], [1][2][3], but then for n=4=2^2 the rules do not say whether [3]<[4] or [4]<[3], although they do say that [2]<[4], so we get two orderings [1][2][3][4], [1][2][4][3]."
