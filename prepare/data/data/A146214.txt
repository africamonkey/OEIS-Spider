        "The Gcc with Gmp program is at the bottom of the link. The link also has a PARI bisection algorithm which gives a very good approximation for the n-th prime number and the n-th twin prime number. For example the 10^10-th lower twin prime approximation is 6100475249386, this has a relative error of 0.000000698... from the actual a(10) above.",
