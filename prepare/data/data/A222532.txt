        "Conjecture: For any given prime p, if we define b(1)=p and let b(n+1) be the least prime p_m such that b(n)=p_m-p_{m-1}+...+(-1)^{m-k}p_k for some 0<k<m, then a(n)=b(n') for some positive integers n and n'. In other words, if we take all the primes as vertices of a simple graph T and let two vertices p and q>p adjacent if and only if q is the least prime p_m such that p=p_m-p_{m-1}+...+(-1)^{m-k}p_k for some 0<k<m, then the graph T is a tree!",
