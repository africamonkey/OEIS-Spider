    "comment": [
        "Let a(n) := max{ a in N: (10^n-a)^2 > 10^(2*n-1) } then a(n) = floor(10^n*(1-sqrt(0.1))) is easily obtained by solving a quadratic equation. When proving that a(n) satisfies the definition, one has to use the following inequality, due to the fact that 10^n*(1-sqrt(0.1)) is never an integer: floor(10^n*(1-sqrt(0.1))) < 10^n*(1-sqrt(0.1)).",
        "The exponent (2*n - 1) in the definition of the sequence was chosen because with a number of n decimal digits, the greater of the two possible lengths obtained when squaring it is 2*n. Since 10^(2*n-1) is the smallest decimal number with 2*n digits, (10^n - a(n)) gives the minimum number to obtain the maximum length by squaring it."
