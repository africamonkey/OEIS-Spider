        "The decimal expansion of 10^10^10^10^2 - 1 would be 1 googolplex digits long, with each digit a 9. Many factors of this number can be identified using simple facts of modular arithmetic.",
        "Since its digits are all 9's, it is divisible by 9=3*3. Since its digits are all 9's and the number of digits is even, it is divisible by 99 (as are 9999=99*101, 999999=99*10101, 99999999=99*1010101, etc.), and thus divisible by 11.",
        "By the same principle, it is divisible by 9999, 99999, 99999999, and by any other number whose decimal expansion consists of k 9's where k is of the form 2^a * 5^b, where a and b are nonnegative integers up to 10^100 (see A003592) and all their divisors. Additional factors can be found using Fermat's Little Theorem.",
        "Consequently, a large number of factors of 10^10^10^10^2 - 1 are known. (End)"
