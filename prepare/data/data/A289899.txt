        "A Wieferich cycle is a repeating cycle in the trajectory of p under successive applications of the map p -> A039951(p), i.e., a part of a row of A288097 repeating indefinitely.",
        "The above cycles could more precisely be called \"order-1 Wieferich cycles\". A cycle in a row of A281002 could be called an \"order-2 Wieferich cycle\".",
        "The cycles corresponding to a(1)-a(3) are {3, 11, 71}, {2, 1093} and {83, 4871}, respectively.",
        "The order of the cycle is not to be confused with its length. The order-1 cycle {3, 11, 71} is a cycle of length 3, while the order-1 cycles {2, 1093} and {83, 4871} are cycles of length 2.",
        "Wieferich cycles are special cases of Wieferich tuples (cf. A271100).",
