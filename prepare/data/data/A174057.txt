        "The subsequence of prime semi-sums (means) of a Fermat prime and a Mersenne prime begins: 3, 5, 17, 65537 = (3 + 131071)/2. _R. J. Mathar_, on the remaining primes in the half sum, searched through all sums that can be created from the existing values of the two OEIS sequences, and that the next Fermat prime is known to be > 2^(2^32) + 1. So it is safe to say that the next prime > 65537 in the half sum (if it exists) is larger than 85070591730234615865843651857942085632, because adding that huge next Fermat prime would lead to even larger numbers. Of course one could easily boost that estimate by using the b-file of A000668."
