        "Up to the initial 0 in A165288, these two sequences appear to be the same, but according to its current definition, A165288 should be the same as the (different) sequence A229618 = the range of the sequence A181138 (= least k>0 such that n^2+k is a cube): If n^2+k=y^3 is the smallest cube above n^2, then n^2 is not necessarily the largest square below y^3. E.g., 18 is in A181138 and A229618, since 9+18=27 is the least cube above 9=3^2, but 25=5^2 is the largest square below 27. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 05 2013"
