        "Any multiple of a member is also a member. A member that is not a multiple of another member is called primitive. Using elliptic curves, Jacobi and Madden prove that there are infinitely many primitive members. According to them, the only primitive members less than 222,000 are 5491 (due to Brudno) and 51361 (due to Wroblewski)."
