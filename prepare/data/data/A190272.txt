        "This sequence is infinite, assuming Dickson's conjecture. In fact, the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many members of this sequence divisible by any fixed prime p. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 08 2011",
        "Related to Rassias Conjecture (\"for any odd prime p there are primes q < r such that p*q = q+r+1\") setting n = q*r, a = q+r+1. The sequence includes the cases with p = q (or p = r). Generalization can be achieved by removing semiprimality condition or accepting GCD(n,a)=1. The differential equation in its general form n'=a+1 includes Primary Pseudoperfect i.e., n' = n-1 (A054377)."
