        "Previous analysis of this cellular automaton have concentrated on cells that turn \"ON\". This sequence examines those cells that are never turned ON.",
        "This cellular automaton is generated by Rule 686 using the Wolfram numbering scheme.",
        "A \"POISONED\" cell is one in which no further generation can possibly utilize that cell. That is, previous generations have ensured that more than one neighbor has been turned ON.",
        "See A147562 for extensive definitions, references and links for this cellular automaton.",
        "Note that the offset is zero, which implies that the initial cell is at stage n=1. This corresponds to that of A147562 where a(0)=0, a(1)=1, a(2)=5, etc.  The Singmaster reference implies a(0)=1, a(1)=5, etc.  The choice of offset is arbitrary and neither seems to be ideal.",
