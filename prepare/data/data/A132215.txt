        "This is to 8th powers as A132214 is to 7th powers, A130555 is to 6th powers, A130292 is to fifth powers, A130873 is to 4th powers and A120398 is to cubes. These CAN be prime, as the polynomial x^8 + y^8 is irreducible over Z, as seen in A132216. The first such example is a(11) = A132216(1) = 2^8 + 13^8 = 256 + 815730721 = 815730977, which is prime.",
