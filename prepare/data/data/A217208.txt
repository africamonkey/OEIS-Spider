        "Start with an initial string S of n numbers s(1), ..., s(n), all = 2 or 3. The rule for extending the string is this:",

        "The \"tail length\" t(S) of S is defined as follows: start with S and repeatedly append the curling number (recomputing it at each step) until a 1 is reached; t(S) is the number of terms that are appended to S before a 1 is reached. If a 1 is never reached, set t(S)=oo .",
        "The \"Curling Number Conjecture\" is that if one starts with any finite string and repeatedly extends it by appending the curling number k, then eventually one must reach a 1. This has not yet been proved.",
        "The values shown for n >= 49 are only conjectures, because certain assumptions used to cut down the search have not yet been rigorously justified. However, we believe that ALL terms shown are correct."
