        "The sequence is finite with a(15)=39 as last term, since numbers m>39 can be represented as sums of squares>1 (even of squares of primes and even of squares of 2, 3 and 4 and even of squares of 2, 3 and 5) in at least two ways. Proof: if m=40+4k, k>=0, then m=(k+10)*2^2=(k+1)*2^2+4*3^2; if m=41+4k, then m=(k+8)*2^2+3^2=(k+4)*2^2+5^2; if m=42+4k, then m=(k+6)*2^2+2*3^2=(k+2)*2^2+3^2+5^2; if m=43+4k, then m=(k+4)*2^2+3*3^2=k*2^2+2*3^2+5^2. - _Hieronymus Fischer_, Nov 11 2007"
