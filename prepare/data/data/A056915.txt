        "These first 13 numbers are the only ones less than 25*10^9 which are simultaneously strong pseudoprimes to bases 2, 3 and 5. Taken from the same table - which indicates (only) whether they are also strong pseudoprime (spsp) or pseudoprime (psp) to base 7, 11 and/or 13: 161304001 is spsp to 11; 3215031751 is spsp to base 7 and is psp to both bases 11 and 13; 5764643587 is spsp to base 13; 14386156093 is psp to bases 7, 11 and 13. 15579919981 is psp to base 7 and spsp to base 11; 19887974881 is psp to base 7; and 21276028621 is psp to bases 11 and 13."
