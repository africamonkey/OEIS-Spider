    "comment": [
        "This combination of elliptic functions appears in the expression for the vector potential generated by a circular loop of current. The denominators are powers of 2. The base-2 logarithm of the denominators increments in pattern related to A090739. That latter sequence begins 3,4,3,5,3,4,3,6. Add 2 to each entry; thus, 5,6,5,7,5,6,5,8. Duplicate each entry; thus, 5,5,6,6,5,5,7,7,5,5,6,6,5,5,8,8. Now insert a 2 at the beginning and between each entry; thus, 2,5,2,5,2,6,2,6,2,5,2,5,2, 7,2,7,2,5,2,5,2,6,2,6,2,5,2,5,2,8,2,8. Finally, prepend a 4; thus 4,2,5,2,5,2,6,2,6,2,5,2,5,2,7,2,7,2,5,2,5,2,6,2,6,2,5,2,5,2,8,2,8. This yields the pattern of increments in the base-2 logarithm of the denominators. See also the construction of the ruler sequence A007814."
