        "The value of A000983(9) = 62 means that any dominating set in G=HypercubeGraph[9] has size 62 or more. 9*62 > 512 so there cannot be 9 disjoint dominating sets in G. That there exist 8 disjoint dominating sets for G follows from the existence of 8 such sets for HypercubeGraph[8]: simply take any element in such a set and append both a 0 and 1 to it to turn it into a dominating set in dimension 9. The comment at A000983 about the dominating number for 10 being between 107 and 120 means that the domatic number here for n = 10 is either 8 or 9. - _Stan Wagon_, Jul 15 2017"
