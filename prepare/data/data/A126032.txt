        "The old definition was: Numbers n such that A123669(n) = -1, or no generalized Fermat prime exists of the form (2n)^(2^k) + 1. But that sequence is probably missing a lot of terms, such as {6, 9, 11, 19, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, ...}, where no generalized Fermat prime has been found yet, and it seems unlikely any exist. Currently it can only be proved that none exist if n is of form b^m/2 for even b and odd m > 1. The listed terms are the first numbers of this form: 4 = 2^3/2, 16 = 2^5/2, 32 = 4^3/2, 64 = 2^7/2, 108 = 6^3/2, 256 = 2^9/2 = 8^3/2, 500 = 10^3/2. - _Jens Kruse Andersen_, Jul 24 2014",
