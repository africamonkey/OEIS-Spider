        "Note the triplets of consecutive zeros in A125211(n) for n = {{50,51,52}, {56,57,58}, {86,87,88}, {92,93,94}, ...}. Most zeros in A125211(n) have even indices. The middle index of most consecutive zero triplets in A125211(n) is odd and is a multiple of 3. Numbers n such that no prime exists of the form (k! - 3n - 1), (k! - 3n), (k! - 3n + 1) are listed in A125213(n) = {17,19,29,31,45,49,57,59,63,69,73,79,83,85,87,89,97,99,...}. The first pair of odd middle indices of zero triplets that are not divisible by 3 is n = 325 and n = 329. They belong to the first septuplet of consecutive zeros in A125211(n). A125211(n) = 0 for 7 consecutive terms from n = 324 to n = 330."
