        "This \"predicts\" that a(3) starts with a digit \"3\", so a(3)=30 is the smallest possible choice.",
        "The next digit \"3\" must not appear until the 30th digit of the sequence, so we fill in terms 40,41,42,44,45... (omitting 43 which has a digit \"3\").",
        "Now it happens that the term 53 would correspond to digits # 29 and 30=a(3) of the sequence, so we can simply continue with this and 4 more terms, up to 57.",
        "The next term must have its second digit (digit # 40=a(4) of the sequence) equal to 3, so 63 is the smallest choice.",

        "The terms 44,45,46 and 47,48,49,50 and 51,52,53,54,55 lead to the subsequent terms 333, 3333, 33333."
