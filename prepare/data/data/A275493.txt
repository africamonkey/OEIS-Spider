        "It is not known unconditionally whether there is an infinite number of primitive weird numbers (PWN, A002975), although numerical data provides strong evidence: even the number of weird numbers of the form 2^k*p*q (A258882, A258333) seems to increase fast as k increases. Melfi has shown that Cramer's conjecture implies infiniteness of PWN."
