        "On Jan 10 2009, _Zhi-Wei Sun_ conjectured that any integer greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of an odd prime and a term in the above sequence; in other words, each n=6,7,... can be written in the form p+P_s+2*P_t with p an odd prime and s,t>0. This has been verified up to 5*10^13 by _D. S. McNeil_ (from London Univ.). Motivated by this conjecture, Qing-Hu Hou (from Nankai Univ.) observed and _Zhi-Wei Sun_ proved that each term a(n) in the above sequence can be uniquely written in the form P_s+2P_t with s,t>0. Sun noted that 2176 cannot be written as the sum of a prime and two Pell numbers; _D. S. McNeil_ found that 393185153350 cannot be written in the form p+P_s+3P_t and 872377759846 cannot be written in the form p+P_s+4P_t, where p is a prime and s and t are nonnegative.",
        "_Zhi-Wei Sun_ has offered a monetary reward for settling this conjecture."
