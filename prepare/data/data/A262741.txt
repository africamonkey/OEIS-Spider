        "Absent numbers cannot appear in the sequence A135506. Moreover, if the first term of that sequence, which is 1, is replaced by any other positive integer, absent numbers still do not appear (see the link). The rest of the odd composite numbers are called present numbers, which are the sequence A262748."
