        "All terms listed in the data section are deficient, but all 8-multiperfect numbers (which are abundant...) also belong to this sequence.",
        "As with A230538, it is possible to find larger numbers with same ratio sigma(n)/n, in some cases using perfect numbers A000396 (see a230043.txt link). - _Michel Marcus_, Oct 30 2013",
        "One motivation for this sequence lies in the fact that n*sigma(n) is a square (A069070) if and only if sigma(n)/n is a rational square. But this does not hold for higher powers: If sigma(n)/n = (p/q)^k then n*sigma(n) = (pq)^k (n/q^k)^2. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 02 2013",
        "In his post to NMBRTHRY, Michiel Kosters gives a 233-digit number x such that sigma(x^3) is a cube. Actually this x^3 also belongs to the sequence, although there are no cubes in the current data. He has found many others such cubes that belong here, the smallest of which is 3590918978816938469301573291605^3, x having 31 digits, and x^3 92 digits. Is it possible to find the smallest such cube, or even a smaller one? - _Michel Marcus_, Jan 02 2014"
