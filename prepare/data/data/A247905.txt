        "Refer to A247620, which is the \"vertex to vertex\" expansion version. For this case, the expandable vertices of the existing generation will contact the sides of the new ones i.e. \"vertex to side\" expansion version. Let us assign the label \"1\" the hexagon at the origin; at n-th generation add a hexagon at each expandable vertex, i.e. each vertex where the added generations will not overlap the existing ones, although overlaps among new generations are allowed. The non-overlapping hexagons will have the same label value as a predecessor; for the overlapping ones, the label value will be sum of label values of predecessors. a(n) is the sum of all label values at n-th generation. The hexagons count is A003215. See illustration. For n >= 1, (a(n) - a(n-1))/6 is A027383."
