        "The sums of two distinct nonzero Fibonacci numbers is essentially the same sequence: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, ... (only 2 is missing), since F(i) + F(i) = F(i-2) + F(i+1). - _Colm Mulcahy_, Mar 02 2008",
        "To elaborate on Mulcahy's comment above: all terms of A078642 are in this sequence; those are numbers with two distinct representations as the sum of two Fibonacci numbers, which are, as Alekseyev proved, numbers of the form 2*F(i) greater than 2. - _Alonso del Arte_, Jul 07 2013"
