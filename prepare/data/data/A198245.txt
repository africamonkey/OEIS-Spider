        "The even-indexed Euler numbers are A028296, the odd-indexed Euler numbers are all zero.",
        "Numerous combinatorial congruences recently obtained by Z. W. Sun and by Z. H. Sun contain the Euler numbers E(p-3) with a prime p.",
        "Namely, many of these congruences become \"supercongruences\" if and only if E(p - 3) == 0 (mod p).",
        "Only three primes less than 3 * 10^6 satisfy this condition (the current members of the sequence).",
        "Such primes have been recently suggested by Z. W. Sun; namely, Sun found the first and the second such primes, 149 and 241, and used them to discover supercongruences involving E(p - 3).",
        "This is reported by Zhi Wei Sun on Feb 08 2010 and the third prime was found by Romeo Mestrovic (on Sep 26 2011).",
