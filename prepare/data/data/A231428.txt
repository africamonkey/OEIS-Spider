        "The N X N binary matrix of an equivalence relation is perfectly defined by its upper-right triangle. We encode such a matrix with the (N*(N-1))/2 bit number obtained by joining together each line of the upper-right triangle. The numbers are converted to base 10.",
        "This is an infinite sequence and can be used for arbitrarily large values of N. To enumerate the finite list of n X n matrices for a given n, truncate this sequence to the first A000110(n) elements."
