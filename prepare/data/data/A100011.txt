    "name": "Iterated hyperdodecahedron numbers, starting with hyperdodecahedron(2) = 600. The hyperdodecahedron numbers are 4-dimensional figurate numbers based on the 120-cell regular polytope, also known as the hecatonicosachoron or hyperdodecahedron. This sequence is hyperdodecahedron(2), hyperdodecahedron(hyperdodecahedron(2)) and so on recursively.",
    "comment": [
        "This need not start at hyperdodecahedron(2) = 600. For example, starting at a(0) = 33, which is not a hyperdodecahedron number, we have a(1) = hyperdodecahedron(33) = 33*((261*33^3)-(504*33^2)+(283*33)-38)/2 = 145860033; a(2) = hyperdodecahedron(hyperdodecahedron(33)) = hyperdodecahedron(145860033) = 59068471906029484694371097524860033."
