    "comment": [
        "a(1)=25 is the only term in the sequence that ends in 5. Proof: Any number ending in 5 is divisible by 5, and no square ending in 5 can have all 0 internal digits. Let N=A+B where A=N-5 and B=5. Then N^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2. B^2 is 25, and because A ends in a zero, A^2 and 2AB ends in two zeros; therefore the sum ends in 25.",
        "All other terms end in 1 or 9, because no square ends in 3 or 7.",
        "Observation: The sequence often experiences large gaps when the most-significant digit is square. For example, there is a gap of over 10^8 between a(764)=99420841 and a(765)=200307409, and over 10^9 between a(9156)=39980402401 and a(9157)=50000984881.",
        "These gaps occur because if n^2 = (10^k*d+r)^2 = 10^(2k)d^2+r*(2*10^k+r) with d=1, 2, or 3 and r small enough so that the first digit of n^2 is d^2, then removing that digit d^2 we are left with r*(2*10^k+r) which is divisible by r and thus cannot be prime if r>1. - _Giovanni Resta_, May 23 2013",
