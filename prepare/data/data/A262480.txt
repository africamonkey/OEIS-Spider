        "A permutation pattern is c-Wilf equivalent to its complement and reverse and therefore we can get trivial equivalence classes based on complement and reverse. a(3) = 2 because there are two trivial c-Wilf equivalence classes {123, 321} and {132, 231, 213, 321}.",

        "The numbers of c-Wilf equivalence classes in S_n are still unknown for large n. Up to 6, they are 1, 1, 2, 7, 25, 92."
