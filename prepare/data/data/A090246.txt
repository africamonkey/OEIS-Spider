    "comment": [
        "P(Z/3Z)^n is the projective space of n dimensions over the finite field Z/3Z. This is the size of the largest subset which does not contain 3 points lying in a line.",
        "Davis and Maclagan described a game similar to the game SET that could be played in this space using projective lines, rather than in (Z/3Z)^n using the algebraic notion of line. This sequence is the analog of A090245 for this game.",
        "So far this sequence agrees with A104442."
