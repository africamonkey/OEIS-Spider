        "All Ramanujan primes (A104272) are in A164368 and all Labos primes (A080359) are in A194598. Peculiar primes (see comment in A164554)are simultaneously Ramanujan and Labos primes, while central primes (A166252) are in the intersection of A164368 and A194598 for n>=2. Hence, for n>=2, all peculiar primes are central primes, but conversely is not true. The sequence lists non-peculiar central numbers."
