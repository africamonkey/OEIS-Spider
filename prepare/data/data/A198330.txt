        "A198329(n) is the Matula-Goebel number of the rooted  tree obtained by removing from the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n the vertices of degree one, together with their incident edges. If the repeated application of this pruning operation will not lead to the Matula-Goebel number 2 (corresponding to the 1-edge tree), then the starting rooted tree is central. The Maple program is based on this."

        "7 is in the sequence because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 7 is Y which is central. 5 is not in the sequence because the corresponding rooted tree is the path-tree on 4 vertices, a bicentral tree."
