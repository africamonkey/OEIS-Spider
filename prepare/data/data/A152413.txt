        "Wilson's theorem states that (p-1)! == -1 (mod p) for every prime p. Wilson primes are the primes p such that p^2 divides (p-1)! + 1. They are listed in A007540. Wilson's theorem can be expressed in general as (n-1)!(p-n)! == (-1)^n (mod p) for every prime p >= n. Generalized Wilson primes order n are the primes p such that p^2 divides (n-1)!(p-n)! - (-1)^n.",
        "Alternatively, prime p=prime(k) is a generalized Wilson prime order n iff A002068(k) == A007619(k) == H(n-1) (mod p), where H(n-1) = A001008(n-1)/A002805(n-1) is (n-1)-st harmonic number. For this sequence (n=17), it reduces to A002068(k) == A007619(k) == 2436559/720720 (mod p)."
