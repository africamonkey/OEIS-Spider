        "Let sigma(n) denote the sum of divisors of n, and s(n) := sigma(n) - n. Untouchable numbers are those numbers that do not lie in the image of s(n), and they were studied extensively (see the references). In 2016, Pollack and Pomerance conjectured that the set of untouchable numbers has a natural asymptotic density.",
