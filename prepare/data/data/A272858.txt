        "A048102 is clearly a subsequence, as for any prime p, p^p satisfy the herein condition. Similarly, A122406 is also a subsequence. More generally, if a number is a term, then any permutation of the exponents in its prime factorization (i.e., any permutation of its prime signature) gives also a term.",
