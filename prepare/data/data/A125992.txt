Also 17 belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {-1,0|}, where, as the option -1 is dominated by option 0, the former can be deleted, resulting the same game {0|}. Also code 65536 (= 2^(2*(2^(1+2*1)))) belongs into this sequence, as it encodes the game {{|1}|}, which is reversible to game 1."
