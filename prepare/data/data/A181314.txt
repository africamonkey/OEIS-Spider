        "a(n) = ADPE(n) is the total number of aperiodic k-double-palindromes of n up to cyclic equivalence. See sequence A181169 for the definitions of an aperiodic k-double-palindrome of n and of cyclic equivalence.",
        "Sequence A181169 is the 'ADPE(n,k)' triangle read by rows where ADPE(n,k) is the number of aperiodic k-double-palindromes of n up to cyclic equivalence.",
        "For example, we have a(6) = ADPE(6) = ADPE(6,1) + ADPE(6,2) + ADPE(6,3) + ADPE(6,4) + ADPE(6,5) + ADPE(6,6) = 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 6. The 6 aperiodic double-palindromes of 6 up to cyclic equivalence are: 15, 24, 114, 1113, 1122, 11112. They are the representatives of the cyclic equivalence classes: {15,51}, {24,42}, {114,411,141},{1113,3111,1311,1131}, {1122,2112,2211,1221} and {11112,21111,12111,11211,11121}.",
