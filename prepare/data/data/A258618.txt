        "The smallest integer that satisfies this is 240: It has 19 proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120) and 6 prime factors (2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5), so d(240)=13. The square of 240, 57600, we would expect to have a difference of 68 between the number of its proper divisors and prime factors, and with respectively 80 and 12, d(57600)=68 indeed. Checking this with further integer powers of 240 will continue to generate terms in this sequence."
