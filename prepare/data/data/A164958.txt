    "comment": [
        "For k>1 (not necessarily integer), we call a Labos k-prime L_n^(k) the prime a_k(n) which is the smallest number such that pi(a_k(n)) - pi(a_k(n)/k)= n. Note that, the sequence of all primes corresponds to the case of \"k=oo\". Let p be a k-Labos prime, such that p/k is in the interval (p_m, p_(m+1)), where p_m>=3 and p_n is the n-th prime. Then the interval (k*p_(m), p) contains a prime. Conjecture. For every k>1 there exist non-k-Labos primes, which possess the latter property. For example, for k=2, the smallest such prime is 131. Problem. For every k>1 to estimate the smallest non-k-Labos prime, which possess the latter property. [From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Sep 02 2009]",
