        "Erd\u0151s showed in 1956 how to construct Carmichael numbers from a given number n (see A287840). With appropriate sign changes the method can be used to generate Lucas-Carmichael numbers. Given a number n, let P be the set of primes p such that (p+1)|n but p is not a factor of n. Let c be a product of a subset of P with at least 3 elements. If c == -1 (mod n) then c is a Lucas-Carmichael number.",
        "The corresponding number of generated Lucas-Carmichael numbers are 1, 3, 5, 9, 21, 169, 681, 900, 1842, 7250, 29132, 77482, 932187, 4970111, 7456418."
