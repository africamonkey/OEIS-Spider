        "Recursively build matrices by setting M(0) = [1], and M(k+1)=[M(k),E(k); E(k),Z(k)] where E(k) is the N x N unit matrix and Z(k) is the N x N zero matrix (and N=2^k). Let c(x) the characteristic polynomial (over GF(2)) of the upper left n x n submatrix. If c(x), divided by the least power of x with nonzero coefficient, is irreducible over GF(2) then n is a term of this sequence (see example).",
