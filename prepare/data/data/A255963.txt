        "Starting with the empty set {}, we can repeatedly take the power set, say, n times, to obtain the n-th power set. If we write out the n-th power set, a(n) is the number of occurrences of {} in this written form. For n>0, this corresponds with the total number of empty sets contained in the n-th power set in any level of the set hierarchy.",
