    "comment": [
        "Inclusion of the single-digit terms is conventional: here the property is voidly satisfied since no sum can be constructed by inserting a + sign between two digits, therefore all possible sums are prime. (It is not allowed to prefix a leading zero (e.g., to forbid 4 = 04 = 0+4) since in that case all terms must be prime and one would get A089392.)",
        "All terms different from 20 and not of the form 10^k+1 have the last digit of opposite parity than that of all other digits.",
        "The sequence is marked as \"finite\", although we do not have a rigorous proof for this, only very strong evidence (numerical and probabilistic). G. Resta has checked that up to 5e16 the only magnanimous numbers with more than 11 digits are 5391391551358 and 97393713331910, the latter being probably the largest element of this sequence. In that case the 10+33+79+104+112+96+71+35+18+6+5+0+1+1 = 571 terms listed in Wilson's b-file are the complete list, which is what the keyword \"full\" stands for."
