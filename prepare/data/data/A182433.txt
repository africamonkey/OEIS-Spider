    "comment": [
        "These are found by an application of the Chinese remainder theorem. The remainders are the numbers prime(n)^2 - n (A182174), and the moduli are the squares of primes (A001248).",
        "This guarantees a run of at least n nonsquarefree numbers. But just as n! + 1 guarantees a run of at least n - 1 composite numbers, this might not be the smallest run of n nonsquarefree numbers (for that, see A045882).",
        "Marmet credits Erick Bryce Wong with the idea of applying the Chinese remainder theorem and a sieving process to obtain upper limits for squarefree gaps. From this it occurred to me to just apply the Chinese remainder theorem to find these squarefree gaps exhibiting the squares of primes in order.",
        "Also, beyond a(4), that is n > 4, we will observe that some of the numbers in the run of nonsquarefree numbers are divisible by more than one prime power, e.g., a(n) + 5 is divisible both by 49 (the square of the fourth prime) and 4."
