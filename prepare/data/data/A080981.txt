        "Donaghey defines (on page 82 of his paper) the branch-reduced zigzag-trees as those zigzag-trees which do not contain longer than one-edge branches, where a branch is a maximal connected set of edges slanted to the same direction, with no perpendicular edges emanating from its middle. These form the primitive elements of the automorphism A057505/A057506."
