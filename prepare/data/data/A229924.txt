        "A (d+1)-pyramid polycube is a (d+1)-polycube obtained by gluing together horizontal (d+1)-plateaux (parallelepipeds of height 1) in such a way that the cell (0,0,...,0) belongs to the first plateau and each cell with coordinates (0,n_1,...,n_d) belonging to the first plateau is such that n_1 , ... , n_d >= 0.",
