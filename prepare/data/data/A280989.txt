Out of the 340 who test positive, 95 people have the disease and 95/340 = 19/68 = .279..., which rounds to 28%, so a(2) = 28 -- about 28% of the people who tested positive actually have the tested-for disease. On the other hand, only 5/4660 = .00107... or roughly .1% of the people who tested negative actually have the affliction."
