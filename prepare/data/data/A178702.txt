        "For a given positive integer, n, let S_n be the set of partitions of n into distinct parts where the number of parts is maximal for that n.  For example, for n=6, the set S_6 consists of just one such partition S_6={1,2,3}.  Similarly, for n=7, S_7={1,2,4},  But for n=8, S_8 will contain two partitions S_8= { {1,2,5}, {1,3,4} }.  Now form the sum whose general term is x^n divided by the product (1-x^(p_1))...(1-x^(p_i)) where the p's come from the partitions in S_n.  The sequence is the sequence of coefficients of this sum.",
