    "comment": [
        "It appears that the set of numbers that produces a given ordered pair (i,j) is either empty, finite, or infinite. The pair (3,3) is produced by no number because d(n)=3 only if n is a positive square and there are no consecutive positive squares. Sequence A161460 lists n that produce a unique ordered pair. It appears that the ordered pair (4,2) is produced by an infinite number of n, which is another way of conjecturing that there are an infinite number of safe primes, A005385. The pair (2,4) is produced by primes in A005383. The numbers in A039832 produce the pair (4,4)."
