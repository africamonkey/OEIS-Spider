        "A268416 gives the number of polyominoes that fill fit inside a square n X n, but with the restriction that they have their edges aligned with the sides of the square. The current sequence removes the restriction, and hence differs from A268416 at a(5), which is 848 greater here. See link \"Explanation of a(5)\"."
