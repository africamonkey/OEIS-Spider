        "Differences |a(i)-a(j)| are prime powers for all i,j. Conjecture: sequence is bounded.",
        "Proof that sequence is complete: Assume there is some k after the term 12. Then {k-1, k-3, k-5} must contain a multiple of 3. Also {k-8,k-10,k-12} also contains a multiple of 3. No prime > 12 is a multiple of 3, so the multiples of 3 are both prime powers. This implies there must be two powers of 3 that have a difference at most 11, but no such pair exists > 12 (only 1,3 and 3,9 qualify.) - _Jim Nastos_, Aug 09 2002",
