        "Archimedes' spiral with polar equation r=c(pi + a) (c>0; a is the angle) defines a family of permutations: 1 is placed at the origin of the XY-plane and each time, as a increases, that r hits the X-axis we put the next number on the X-axis; reading the numbers from left to right yields the permutation of 1..N (N>=2): N-1 N-3 ... 5 3 1 2 4 6 ... N-1 N (N is even), N N-2 ... 5 3 1 3 4 6 ... N-3 N-1 (N is odd). N is A^-_1-prime if (i) this permutation consists of a single cycle of length N, and (ii) N=3 (mod 4). So all A^-_1-primes are odd.",
        "No formula is known for a(n): the A^-_1-primes have been found by exhaustive search. But we have: N is A^-_1-prime iff N=3 (mod 4), p=2N+1 is a prime number and -2 generates Z_p^* (the multiplicative group of Z_p) but +2 does not."
