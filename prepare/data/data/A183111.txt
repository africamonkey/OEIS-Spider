        "A. The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [RED ; BLUE ; NEUTRAL] or [NEUTRAL ; RED ; BLUE], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the sequence is optimal (the sequence presented gives the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle for the given pre-coloring configurations). Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",

        "C. The above-listed \"original\" sequence generates a \"partial-sums\" sequence - describing the total number of moves required to solve the puzzle.",
        "D. The number of moves of disk k, for large k, is close to (10/11)*3^(k-1) ~ 0.909*3^(k-1). Series designation: P909(k)."
