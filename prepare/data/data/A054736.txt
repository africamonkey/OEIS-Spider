    "comment": [
        "In Fibonacci Nim, the first player takes any number of stones (except all) and then each player takes no more than twice the number taken in the previous move. This sequence concerns the game where 2 is replaced by 3."

        "If your opponent has just removed 1 or 2 stones from the pile leaving you with 8, then you lose. Any fewer stones after your opponent has taken 2 will be a win for you."
