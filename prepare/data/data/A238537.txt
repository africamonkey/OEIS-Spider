        "Let P and Q be integers. The Lucas sequences U(n) and V(n) (which depend on P and Q) are a pair of integer sequences that satisfy the recurrence equation a(n) = P*a(n-1) - Q*a(n-2) with the initial conditions U(0) = 0, U(1) = 1 and V(0) = 2, V(1) = P, respectively. The sequence {U(n)}n>=1 is a divisibility sequence, i.e., U(n) divides U(m) whenever n divides m and U(n) <> 0. In general the sequence V(n) is not a divisibility sequence. However, it can be shown that if p >= 3 is an odd integer then the sequence {U(p*n)*V(n)}n>=1 is a divisibility sequence satisfying a linear recurrence of order 4. For a proof and a generalization of this result see the Bala link. Here we take p = 3 with P = 2 and Q = -1, for which U(n) is the sequence of Pell numbers A000129, and consider the normalized divisibility sequence with initial term equal to 1. For other sequences of this type see A238536 and A238538"
