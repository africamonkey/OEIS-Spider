    "comment": [
        "Prime quintuplets (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12) are one of the two types of densest permissible constellations of 5 primes (A022006 and A022007). Average gaps between prime k-tuples can be deduced from the Hardy-Littlewood k-tuple conjecture and are O(log^k(p)), with k=5 for quintuplets. If a gap is larger than all preceding gaps, we call it a maximal gap, or a record gap. Maximal gaps may be significantly larger than average gaps; this sequence suggests that maximal gaps between quintuplets are O(log^6(p)).",
        "A201063 lists initial primes in quintuplets (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12) preceding the maximal gaps. A233433 lists the corresponding primes at the end of the maximal gaps."
