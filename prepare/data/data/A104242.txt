        "The second prime in this sequence, 144169, arises in the theory of modular forms, as observed by Hecke. On page 671 of Hecke (1937), Hecke works out the cusp forms of weight 24 and observes that the Hecke operators have eigenfunctions with Fourier coefficients in the quadratic field of discriminant 144169. Thanks to Jerrold B. Tunnell for this comment. See also the articles by Hida and Zagier. _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 13 2014"
