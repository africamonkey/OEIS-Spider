    "name": "A list of equal temperaments (equal divisions of the octave) whose nearest scale steps are closer and closer approximations to the ratios of three complementary pairs of simple musical tones: 7/6 and 12/7, 6/5 and 5/3 and 7/5 and 10/7.",
    "comment": [
        "The sequence was found by a computer search of all of the equal divisions of the octave from 1 to over 216082. The self-accumulating nature of this sequence fails once, between the fourth and fifth terms. The sequence therefore does not meet the rigorous definition of 'impeccable' recurrence. The otherwise perfect recurrence in this sequence is of the type seen in sequences A054540, A060526 and A060527. The numerical value of each term represents a musical scale based on an equal division of the octave. 12, for example, signifies the scale which is formed by dividing the octave into 12 equal parts."
