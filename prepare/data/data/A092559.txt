        "Thanks to the recently found factor of F_14 (see A093179), we know that 16384 is not in the sequence. First unknown: 16768. - _Don Reble_, Mar 28 2010",
        "The big prime factors for \"5807\" and all smaller entries have been proved prime; the rest (AFAIK) are probable primes. - _Don Reble_, Mar 28 2010",
        "From _Giuseppe Coppoletta_, May 09 2017: (Start)",
        "As 3 divides 2^a(n) + 1 for any odd a(n), all odd terms are prime and they are exactly the Wagstaff numbers (A000978) or also the prime Jacobsthal indices (A107036).",
        "All terms from a(51) onwards refer to probabilistic primality tests for 2^a(n) + 1 (see Caldwell's link for the list of the largest certified Wagstaff primes).",
        "For the close relationship between this sequence and the Fermat numbers, see comments in A073936. The only difference is that here a term can be the square of a prime p, and by the Mih\u0103ilescu Theorem (also known as Catalan's conjecture, see link) that implies p = a(n) = 3. So, excluding a(1) = 3, they must coincide.",
        "As for A073936, after a(57), the values 267017, 269987, 374321, 986191, 4031399 and 4101572 are also terms, but there still remains the remote possibility of some gaps in between. In addition, 13347311 and 13372531 are also terms, but are possibly much further along in the numbering (see comments in A000978).",
