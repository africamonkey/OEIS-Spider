        "If n is even then at stage n we place toothpicks of length 1 connected by their endpoints in vertical direction, starting from the exposed toothpick endpoint, downward up to touch the structure or up to touch the x-axis.",
        "Note that the number of toothpick of added at stage (n+1)/2 in horizontal direction is also A001511(n) and the number of toothpicks added at stage n/2 in vertical direction is also A006519(n).",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n stages. A228371 (the first differences) gives the number of toothpicks added at the n-th stage.",
        "After 2^k stages a new section of the structure is completed, so the structure can be interpreted as a diagram of the 2^(k-1) compositions of k in colexicographic order, if k >= 1 (see A228525). The infinite diagram can be interpreted as a table of compositions of the positive integers.",
