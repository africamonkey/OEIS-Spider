        "The above conjecture is probably false. A counterexample might be 188748146801, which is in this sequence, as (5, 188748146801) is a double Wieferich prime pair, but is in A124122 only if there exists a prime q != 5 with q < 188748146801 such that (q, 188748146801) is a double Wieferich prime pair. To verify 188748146801 is indeed a counterexample requires to show that no such q exists. - _Felix Fr\u00f6hlich_, May 29 2016.",

The only of those six p for which (p, b) is a double Wieferich prime pair is p = 5, so none of the other p disprove that 188748146801 is a counterexample to the conjecture. - _Felix Fr\u00f6hlich_, Jun 05 2016",
