    "name": "Let a(n) = the number of permutations (p(1),p(2),p(3)...,p(n)) of (1,2,3,...,n) where, if each (m,p(m)) is plotted on a graph, then the entire set P of the n of these plotted points would be on the perimeter of the convex hull of P.",
    "comment": [
        "Three points that are consecutive along the perimeter of the convex hull may be along the same line, in some of the permutations that are counted.",
        "The first 8 terms were calculated by _W. Edwin Clark_. The first 17 terms were calculated by J K Haugland, and posted to the Usenet group sci.math."

        "For n=5, (p(1),p(2),p(3),p(4),p(5)) = (1,3,5,2,4) would be included in the count, but (1,4,3,2,5) would not because point (3,3) is not on the perimeter of the convex hull of P."
