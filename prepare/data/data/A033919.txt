        "Related to the Sierpi\u0144ski number problem.",
        "In an archived website, Payam Samidoost gives these numbers and other results about the dual Sierpi\u0144ski problem. It is conjectured that, for each of these k<78557, there is an m such that k+2^m is prime. Then a covering argument would show that 78557 is the least odd number such that 78557+2^m is composite for all m. The impediment in the \"dual\" problem is that it is currently very difficult to prove the primality of large numbers of the form k+2^m. It is much easier to prove the Proth primes of the form k*2^m+1 which occur in the usual Sierpi\u0144ski problem. According to the distributed search project \"Five or Bust\", 40291 is the only value of k < 78557 for which there is currently no m known making k + 2^m a prime or probable prime. - _T. D.
