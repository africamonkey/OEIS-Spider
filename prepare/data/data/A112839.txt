        "A 7-pillow is a generalized Aztec pillow. The 7-pillow of order n is a rotationally-symmetric region. It has a 2 X 2n central band of squares and then steps up from this band with steps of 7 horizontal squares to every 1 vertical square and steps down with steps of 1 horizontal square to every 1 vertical square."
