For the first three rows, n=0 gives the core sequence A000330, n=1 gives essentially A058373, ignoring the two initial zeros, and n=2 gives -A058372. The first column, for k=0, is A056520, where it is known that A056520(m)=A000300(m)+1. Thus a trivial relation, A191748(m,j)=A056520(m)+j*(m+2)=A000300(m)+j*(m+2)+1, j in {0,...,m}, m>0, with A191748(0,0)=1, gives the triangle",
