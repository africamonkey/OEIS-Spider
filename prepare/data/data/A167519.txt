        "The terms of the sequence give the positions of the digits '0' in the string formed by concatenating all the terms (written in base 10)."

    "example": [
        "The sequence cannot start with 1 (which would mean it starts with 0) or 2 (which would mean that the second term equals 0), so a(1)=3 is the smallest possibility.",
        "Thereafter, the smallest possible value for a(2), which must have '0' as second digit, is a(2)=10.",
        "This means that the next digit '0' must occur at position 10; up to there, we use the smallest possible values for a(3)=11 and a(4)=12.",
        "Then must follow two nonzero digits (which must be part of a(5)) and then three zero digits (from a(2),a(3),a(4) = 10, 11, 12). None of the latter can be the first digit of a(6)), so they must be part of a(5), for which the smallest possibility is therefore a(5)=11000.",
        "This also means that there is no digit '0' between the 12th digit (= the last digit of a(6)), and the 11000th digit of the sequence. So there follow roughly 11000/5 terms which are the smallest possible 5-digit terms without a zero digit."
