        "The ABC conjecture would imply that if the prime factors of A, B, C are prescribed in advance, then there is only a finite number of solutions to the equation A + B = C with gcd(A,B,C)=1 (indeed it would bound C to be no more than \"roughly\" the product of those primes). So in particular there ought to be only finitely many pairs of adjacent integers whose prime factors are limited to {2, 3, 5} (D. Rusin).",
