        "1. 15 is the smallest number which does not follow a cyclic pattern or terminates at k < 10. 2. A pattern is visible. For 12 one gets the cyclic pattern 12->36->63->21->12->36... for 14 one gets 14 ->42->24->8->8... Subsidiary sequences that could be considered: (1) Sequence of numbers which show cyclic pattern. (2) Sequence of numbers which terminate at k,k <10. (3) Numbers which gare not members of (1) and (2)."
