        "Semigroup analog of A063756 Number of groups of order <= n. a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set S closed under an associative binary operation (and thus is an associative groupoid). Some sources require that a semigroup have an identity element (in which case semigroups are identical to monoids). Not all sources agree that S should be nonempty. This sequence assumes that a semigroup may be empty and need not have an identity."
