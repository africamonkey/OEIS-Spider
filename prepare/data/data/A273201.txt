        "For an integer n>0 and not the unity we define DTD(n) to be the difference table of the divisors of n. We say that DTD(n) is positive if all entries in the table are positive and we call DTD(n) monotone if all rows and all columns of the table are nondecreasing (reading from left to right and from top to bottom).",
        "We define an integer n to be prime power-like if and only if DTD(n) is positive and monotone. All prime powers (in the sense of A246655 (but not in the sense of A000961)) are prime power-like integers. Sequence A273200 provides the prime power-like integers. This sequence (A273201) lists the integers which are prime power-like but not prime powers.",
        "Thus we have the inclusions A000040 < A246655 < A273200 and the union A273200 = A273201 U A246655. Integers which have a positive but not monotone DTD are listed in A273199. Integers with a positive DTD are listed in A273130."
