        "The first 20 terms are equal with A057890, after which a(21)=25, while A057890(21)=27. On the other hand, 33 is the first term which occurs in A057890 but does not occur here.",
        "If terms x and y are included, then also their product x*y is included. If term x is included, then 2^k * x is also included. The sequence contains also all primes in A016041 and their mutual multiples. However, in addition to that, there are also terms like 143 = 11*13, where A235027 will map the factors to each other (as their binary expansions '1011' and '1101' are mirror images of each other), even although neither of them is present in A016041. (These latter kind of primes are in A074832).",
