        "3rd column of Table 1. The Growth of Adjacency Matrices with n, p.6, of Arkus. 2nd column is A000088 (number of equivalence classes of sign patterns of totally nonzero symmetric n X n matrices). 1st column might be A006125(n) = 2^(n(n-1)/2). We focus on enumerating only minimally rigid sphere packings; which we define as packings with >= 3 contacts per particle and >= 3n - 6 total contacts. Minimal rigidity is necessary, but not sufficient, for a structure to be rigid. Due to the large number of packings that must be evaluated, this analytical method is implemented computationally, and near n = 10 we reach the method's computational limitations."
