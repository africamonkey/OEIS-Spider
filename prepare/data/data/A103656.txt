        "a(1)=29: Only 58 of the A103157(1)=70 possible ways to choose 4 distinct points from the 8 vertices of a cube result in pyramids with volume > 0: 2 regular tetrahedra of volume=1/3 and 56 triangular pyramids of volume=1/6. The remaining A103658(1)=12 configurations result in objects with volume=0. Therefore a(1)=(1/2)*(A103157(1)-A103658(1))=58/2=29."
