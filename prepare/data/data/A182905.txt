    "name": "Number of weighted lattice paths in F[n]. The members of F[n] are paths of weight n that start at (0,0), do not go below the horizontal axis, and whose steps are of the following four kinds: an (1,0)-step with weight 1, an (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.",
    "comment": [
        "The paths in F[n] need not end on the horizontal axis.",
        "If f(z) is the generating function of the paths in F[n] (according to weight), and g(z) is the generating function of the those paths in F[n] that end on the horizontal axis, then f = g +z^2*gf. Also, g = (1 + zg)(1+z^2*g). Eliminating g from the above two equations, one obtains f(z)."
