        "The number of divisors of a(n) is equal to the number of its digits. This number is equal to 2*A000043(n)-2. The number of divisors of a(n) that are powers of 2 is equal to the number of divisors that are multiples of n-th Mersenne prime A000668(n) and this number of divisors is equal to A090748(n). The first digits of a(n) are \"1\". For n>1 the last digits are \"0\". The number of digits \"1\" is equal to A000043(n). The number of digits \"0\" is equal to A000043(n)-2. The concatenation of digits \"1\" gives the n-th Mersenne prime written in binary (see A117293(n)). The structure of divisors of a(n) represent a triangle (see example)."
