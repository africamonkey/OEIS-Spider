    "comment": [
        "There are no elements in the sequence beyond 99 because of curves in writing hUnDReD, thOUSanD, milliOn, BilliOn, and so forth. If one counts the segments (chisel strokes) then 29 is the unique fixed point of that derived sequence.",
        "Specifically, these are the numbers whose names use only the letters A, E, F, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, X, Y, and Z. [From _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Aug 06 2009]"

        "a(1) = 5 because FIVE is the smallest integer whose English name is written with only straight line segments. 6 is not in the sequence because the letter S has curves. a(2) = 9 because NINE is the next integer whose English name is written with only straight line segments."
