        "Multiples of Pythagorean primes A002144 or of primitive Pythagorean triangles' hypotenuses A008846. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Nov 12 2003",
        "It appears that this is exactly the sequence of positive integers with at least one prime divisor of the form 4k + 1. (This has been verified for all terms less than or equal to 500.) Compare A072592. - _John W. Layman_, Mar 12 2008",
        "The conjecture by Layman is correct. It is well known that the hypotenuses of primitive Pythagorean triples are precisely those numbers with all prime divisors of the form 4k + 1. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Apr 26 2009",
        "Circumradius R of the triangles such that the area, the sides and R are integers. - _Michel Lagneau_, Mar 03 2012",
        "The 2 squares summing to a(n)^2 cannot be equal because sqrt(2) is not rational. - _Jean-Christophe Herv\u00e9_, Nov 10 2013",
        "Closed under multiplication. The primitive elements are those with exactly one prime divisor of the form 4k + 1 with multiplicity one, which are also those for which there exists a unique integer triangle = A084645. - _Jean-Christophe Herv\u00e9_, Nov 11 2013",
        "a(n) are numbers whose square is the mean of two distinct nonzero squares. This creates 1-to-1 mapping between a Pythagorean triple and a \"Mean\" triple. If the Pythagorean triple is written, abnormally, as {j, k, h} where j^2 +(j+k)^2 = h^2, and h = a(n), then the corresponding \"Mean\" triple with the same h is {k, 2j, h} where (k^2 + (k+2j)^2)/2 = h^2. For example for h = 5, the Pythagorean triple is {3, 1, 5} and the Mean triple is {1, 6, 5}. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Mar 01 2015",
        "Integral side lengths of rhombuses with integral diagonals p and q (therefore also with integral areas A because A = pq/2 is some multiple of 24). No such rhombuses are squares. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Apr 09 2017"
