        "We write the nonnegative integers as restricted growth strings (so called by J. Arndt in his book fxtbook.pdf, p. 325) in such a way that the Catalan numbers (cf. A000108) are expressed: 1=1, 10=2, 100=5, 1000=14, etc., 10...0 (with k zeros) = the k-th Catalan number. Once the \"digits\" grow above 9 one needs commas to separate the digits. See Dejter (2017) for the precise definition.",
        "In the paper \"A system of numeration for middle levels\", restricted growth strings (RGSs) are defined as sequences that begin with either 0 or 1, with each successive number to the right being at least zero and at most one greater than its immediate left neighbor. Moreover, apart from case a(0), the RGSs are finite integer sequences of restricted growth which always start with 1 as their first element b_1 in position 1, and from then on, each successive element b_{i+1} in the sequence is restricted to be in range [0,(b_i)+1].",
        "This sequence gives all such finite sequences in size-wise and lexicographic order, represented as decimal numbers by concatenating the integers of such finite sequences (e.g., from [1,2,0,1] we get 1201). The 58784th such sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9], thus a(58784) = 1234567899, after which comes the first RGS, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], where an element larger than 9 is present, which means that the decimal system employed here is unambiguous only up to n=58784. Note that 58785 = A000108(11)-1.",
        "Also, if one considers Stanley's interpretation (u) of Catalan numbers, \"sequences of a_1, a_2, ..., a_n of integers such that a_1 = 0 and 0 <= a_{i+1} <= a_{i} + 1\" (e.g., 000, 001, 010, 011, 012 for C_3), and discards their initial zero, then one has a bijective correspondence with Dejter's RGSs of one element shorter length, which in turn are in bijective correspondence with the first C_n terms of this sequence (by discarding any leading zeros), from a(0) to a(C_n - 1). From this follows that the k-th Catalan number, A000108(k) (k>0), is represented in this system as 1 followed by k-1 zeros: a(1)=1, a(2)=10, a(5)=100, a(14)=1000, etc., and also that there exist exactly A000245(k) RGSs of length k.",
        "Note how this differs from other number representations utilizing Catalan numbers, A014418 and A244159, in that while the latter are base-systems, where a simple weighted Sum_{k} digit(k)*C(k) recovers the natural number n (which the n-th numeral of such system represents), in contrast here it is the sum of appropriate terms in Catalan's Triangle (A009766, A030237), obtained by unranking a unique instance of a certain combinatorial structure (one of the Catalan interpretations), that gives a correspondence with a unique natural number. (Cf. also A014486.)",
        "This sequence differs from \"Semigreedy Catalan Representation\", A244159, for the first time at n=10, where a(10) = 120, while A244159(10) = 121. That is also the first position where A244158(a(n)) <> n.",

        "To find an RGS corresponding to natural number n, one first finds a maximum row index k such that T(k,k-1) <= n in the Catalan Triangle (A009766) illustrated in the Example section. Note that as the last two columns of this triangle consist of Catalan numbers (that is, T(k,k-1) = T(k,k) = A000108(k)), it means that the first number to be subtracted from n is A081290(n) which occurs as a penultimate element of the row A081288(n)-1, in the column A081288(n)-2. The unranking algorithm then proceeds diagonally downwards, keeping the column index the same, and incrementing the row index, as long as it will encounter terms such that their total sum stays less than or equal to n.",

These lists of numbers are then concatenated together as decimal numbers.",

Thus we subtract 38-14 to get 24, and we see that the next term downward on the same diagonal, 28, is too large to accommodate into the same sum, so we go one diagonal up, starting now from T(3,2) = 5. This fits in, so we now have 24 - 5 = 19, and also the next term on the same diagonal, T(4,2) = 9, fits in, so we now have 19-9 = 10. The next term on the same diagonal, T(5,2) = 14, would not fit in anymore, so we rewind ourselves back to penultimate column, but one step up from where we started on this diagonal, so T(2,1) = 2, which fits in, 10 - 2 = 8, also the next one T(3,1) = 3, 8 - 3 = 5, and the next one T(4,1) = 4, 5 - 4 = 1, after which comes T(5,1) = 5 > 1, thus we jump to T(1,0) = 1, 1-1 = 0, and T(2,0)=1 would not fit anymore, thus next time the row would be zero, and the algorithm is ready with 1 (14), 2 (5+9), 3 (2+3+4) and 1 (1) terms collected, whose total sum 14+5+9+2+3+4+1 = 38, thus a(38) = 1231.",
