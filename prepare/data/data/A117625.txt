    "comment": [
        "Note that the requirements imposed on the zigzag-line are neither the weakest nor the strongest imaginable. To relax the conditions, one might allow non-parallel half-lines. To strengthen them, one might demand the connecting line segment to be perpendicular to both half lines but still allow an arbitrary length of it, or go even further and additionally demand that all line segments be of equal length. The two latter cases would lend the problem a metrical nature."
