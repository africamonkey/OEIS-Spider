        "The Prime Number Theorem guarantees that the elements of this sequence exist. It states that the limit of PrimePi(x)*log(x)/x as x goes to infinity exists and is equal to 1. The existence of M follows from the definition of a limit. The a(n) listed are taken from a table of PrimePi(m)*log(m)/m up to m=2*10^6.",
        "The function PrimePi(m)*log(m)/m is less than 1.25506 for all m>1 and is greater than 1 for all m>=17, so the first three a(n) are proved (see the Weisstein reference)."
