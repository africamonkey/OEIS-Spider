        "The abundancy of a number n is defined as sigma(n)/n. Abundant numbers have an abundancy greater than 2. All these numbers must be odd primitive abundant numbers, A006038.",
        "These numbers might be considered the opposite of A119239, which has odd numbers whose abundancy increases. This sequence has terms in common with A171929. A similar sequence for deficient numbers is A188597.",
        "These are odd numbers that are barely abundant. See A071927 for the even version.",
