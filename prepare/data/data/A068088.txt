        "No four consecutive numbers can all be squarefree, as one of them is divisible by 2^2 = 4.",

        "The largest possible run of consecutive multiples of 4 in the sequence is 3: If n, n+4 and n+8 are in the sequence then n+4 and hence n-5 and n+13 must be divisible by 9, so neither n-4 nor n+12 can be in the sequence. - Ulrich Schimke, Apr 13 2002"
