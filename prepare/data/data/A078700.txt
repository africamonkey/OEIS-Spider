        "Because of the symmetry and the beginning and ending conditions, we need to consider only n-1 eyelets on the other side. If considering only the distance from the starting and ending eyelets (the \"level\" of each eyelet-pair) through which the lace is traveling (but ignoring on which side it is), the lace will induce some permutation of {1..(n-1)} after it has visited half of the eyelets (and the remaining half of its route is wholly determined by the symmetry). This gives the factor (n-1)!. Independently of this, the condition that each eyelet has at least one direct connection to the opposite side, means that there is a simple bijection with binary strings of length n with no two consecutive 0's. I.e. we mark 0 when the lace stays on the same side and 1 when it crosses to the other side.",
        "From the starting eyelet the lace can either cross to the other side (but not to the top one) or stay on the same side. However, after visiting half of the eylets, the lace MUST cross to the other side (on the same level), so this leaves n-1 eyelets where the choice is free, except that there can be no two consecutive 0's on the route. This gives the factor Fibonacci(n+1).",
