        "Neither binary repunits (A000225 without the initial 0) nor ternary repunits (A003462 without the initial 0) can be in this sequence, except for 1.",
        "The ternary repunits are numbers of the form (3^k - 1)/2. If k is odd, then (3^k - 1)/2 is even and therefore its binary representation ends in 0. If k is even, then (3^k - 1)/2 = 1 mod 4, which means its binary representation ends in 01.",
        "For much more obvious reasons, numbers with even just one 2 in their ternary representations (A074940) can't be in this sequence. (End)"
