        "A cyclic quadrilateral is a quadrilateral for which a circle can be circumscribed so that it touches each polygon vertex.",
        "A cyclic quadrilateral number n is an integer with at least one decomposition n = a*b*c*d such that the area of the quadrilateral of sides (a,b,c,d) and the circumradius are an integer. Because this property is not always unique, we introduce the notion of  \"cyclic quadrilateral order\" for each cyclic quadrilateral number n, denoted by CQO(n). For example, CQO(2304) = 1 because the decomposition 2304 = 8*8*6*6 is unique with the quadrilateral (8,8,6,6) whose area A is given by Brahmagupta\u2019s formula: A = sqrt((s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)) where  the semiperimeter is s = (a+b+c+d)/2, and where the circumradius R (the radius of the circumcircle) is given by R = sqrt((ab+cd)(ac+bd)(ad+bc))/(4A) => A = sqrt((14-8)(14-8)(14-6)(14-6)) = 48, and R = 5, but CQO(2822400) = 2 because 2822400 = 24*24*70*70 = 40*40*42*42 and the area of the quadrilateral (24,24,70,70) equals 1680 with R = 37 and the area of the quadrilateral (40,40,42,42) equals also 1680 with R = 29.",
        "The number of ways to write n = a*b*c*d with 1 <= a <= b <= c <= d <= n is given by A218320, thus: CQO(n) <= A218320(n).",
        "If n is in this sequence, so is n*k^4 for any k > 0. Thus this sequence is infinite.",
        "In view of the preceding comment, one might call \"primitive\" the elements of the sequence for which there is no k > 1 such that n/k^4 is again a term of the sequence. These elements are 2304, 57600, 230400, 451584, 630000, ..."
