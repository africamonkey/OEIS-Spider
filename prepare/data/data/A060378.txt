        "[References do not list this version of a sieve, only provided inspiration.] \"That so many properties hitherto thought to be unique to the primes are possessed also by the luckies comes as a distinct surprise. If these properties are consequences only of the fact that the primes are generated by a sieving process and have nothing to do with primality, then the primes have been shorn of some of their distinction. ...it seems to be only the randomness of their method of selection that gives them some of the properties connected with their distribution. Ulam suggests that it might be worth investigating the results of other sieving programs.\" Ogilvy and Anderson, pp. 101-102. Is the asymptotic density of these numbers 1/log N as in the primes and luckies?"
