        "We encode an n X n binary matrix reading it antidiagonal by antidiagonal, starting from the least significant bit. A given entry in the sequence therefore represents the infinite family of n X n matrices that can be obtained by adding zero antidiagonals. All of these matrices are symmetrical. This encoding makes it possible to obtain a sequence rather than a table."
