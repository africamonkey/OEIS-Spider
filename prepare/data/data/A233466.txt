        "According to the following theorem I discovered recently, the 20-digit number 18446744047939747845 is in the sequence.",
        "Theorem: If n and m are integers, n<6 and p=2^2^n+m is prime such that p does not divide 2^2^n-1 then p*(2^2^n-1) is a solution to the equation phi(x)=(1/2)*(x+m).",
