Then, for any n > 0, all the coefficients of the polynomial sum_{k=0..n-1}S(m,k,x) are multiples of n, i.e., ((k*m+1)!/(k!)^m)*sum_{h=k..n-1}C(h,k)^m == 0 (mod n) for all k = 0, ..., n-1.",

Conjecture 1 with m = 1 is easy since (k+1)*sum_{h=k..n-1}C(h,k) = (k+1)*C(n,k+1) = n*C(n-1,k) for all k = 0, ..., n-1.
