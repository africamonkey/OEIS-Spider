        "Comment from _Martin Fuller_, Apr 26 2007: Both this sequence and A092965 involve the largest prime of the form (n!/m)+1 but they differ in the allowed values of m. The present sequence allows any integer m dividing n!. But A092965 requires m to be the product of distinct numbers up to n. I believe that the sequences differ at n=104 and n=106: a(104)=(104!/121)+1, A092965(104)=(104!/266)+1, a(106)=(106!/121)+1, A092965(106)=(106!/133)+1."
