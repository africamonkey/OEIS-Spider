        "Theorem: the set of such numbers has natural density 0. Proof: Let y = y(n) = loglog n /logloglog n. Using part 1 of Lemma 2.1 in paper 199 on my home page (joint with Luca), applied to the residue class 1: But for a set of n of density 0, for each integer d < y, there is a prime p|n with p == 1 (mod d). In particular, lambda(n) is divisible by every integer d up to y. Suppose now that gcd(lambda(n),n-1) < gcd(phi(n),n-1). Then there is a prime power q^a such that q^a | phi(n), q^a | n-1, and q^a does not divide lambda(n). Then, but for a set of n of density 0, we would have q^a > y. Since q | lambda(n), we have a at least 2. So, n-1 is divisible by some q^a > y with a >= 2. The set of such n has density 0. QED. - Carl Pomerance, Jan 02 2017",
