        "The graphs are exactly 2-connected, not at least 2-connected.  The graphs were enumerated using plantri (by B.D. McKay & G. Brinkmann) for the purpose of finding compound perfect squared squares.  If all graphs with n edges are generated then all compound squares in order n-1 can be obtained from them. Graphs with minimum degree 3 are also called homeomorphically irreducible."
