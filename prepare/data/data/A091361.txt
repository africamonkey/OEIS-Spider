        "Proof of the conjecture that this is 1 and 2 followed by A016945 follows by considering the 6 cases n=6k-1, 6k, 6k+1, 6k+2, 6k+3 or 6k+4, individual evaluation of A001840(n) with their corresponding 3 formulas quoted in A001840 in each case and searching for solutions of the form A001840(n) = t*n for integer t.",
        "Example: A001840[6k+4]=A001840[3(2k+1)+1]=(2k+2)(6k+5)/2=t*(6k+4) implies t=k+7/6+1/[6(3k+2)] which cannot be solved in integers t and k. So numbers of the form 6k+4 are not members here. (End)"
