        "For all n, it seems to be the case that transits of the circumference occurring exactly at the corners do not exist. The pattern repeats itself at a half circle. The triangle count in a quadrant by rows can be arranged as an irregular triangle as shown in the illustration. The rows count (A242396) is equal to the case centered at (0,0), A242394."
