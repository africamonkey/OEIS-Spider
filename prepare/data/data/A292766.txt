        "These are the \"seeds\" in A291790, that is, every number which blows up under iteration of the map k -> (sigma(k)+phi(k))/2 belongs to one of these trajectories. AT PRESENT ALL TERMS ARE CONJECTURAL.",
        "The trajectories of these numbers are pairwise disjoint for the first 400 steps.",
        "This is unsatisfactory because it is possible that, at some later step, these trajectories may merge, reach a prime (a fixed point), or reach a fraction (and die). However, this seems unlikely on probabilistic grounds - see the remarks of _Andrew R. Booker_ in A292108.",
        "Normally such a sequence would not be included in the OEIS, but exceptions have been made for this and A291790 because a number of people have worked on them, and also in the hope that this will encourage resolution of some of the open questions.",
        "Needs a b-file."
