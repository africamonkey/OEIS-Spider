        "Note that this sequence begins with 7 semiprimes (A001358) but is not a subset of the semiprimes, since a(9) = 31 and 31 (base 4) = 133, which interpreted as base 10 is 133 = 7 * 19, yet 31 (base 10) is prime rather than semiprime. A108873 is the equivalent using base 3. A110603 is the equivalent using base 5. A110604 is the equivalent using base 6. A110605 is the equivalent using base 7. A110606 is the equivalent using base 8. A110607 is the equivalent using base 9."
