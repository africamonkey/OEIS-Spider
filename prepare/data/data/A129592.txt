        "Can three squares with consecutive prime sides prime(i), i=k,..k+2, be contained/morphed in a larger square also with prime sides just slightly greater than required?",
        "The areas are the squares of the prime sides; the total area is their sum prime(k)^2+prime(k+1)^2+prime(k+2)^2, and pulling the square root is the diagonal of the hosting square. The sequence lists the first, prime(k), if this diagonal (rounded up) is a prime number, indicating that a rather tight enclosing square with (again) a prime side length can be found."
