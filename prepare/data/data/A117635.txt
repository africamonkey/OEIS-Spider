    "comment": [
        "The 168 (168-3) is arrived at as the inert gas state electrically when the next f electrons and the first g electrons are filled. It also agrees with the Meastro sequence at 13^2. This approach predicts a relatively stable state about 16 neutrons/protons lower than the Pythagoren approach mentioned in A018226. 168 also has the benefit of being the Klein SPL(2,7) and Fano projective Plane group element number in a geodetic geometric model."
