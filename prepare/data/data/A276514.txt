    "name": "If we call \u201cS\u201d this sequence and consider the k-digit term a(n) of S with digits abcd...k, then a(n+1) = [a(n) + the a-th digit of S + the b-th digit of S + the c-th digit of S + ... + the k-th digit of S].

    "comment": [
        "No such sequence is possible starting with a(1)<5. The sequence is finite and stops with 300, the 49th term (as the third digit of the sequence is a zero, leading to 300+0+0+0 = 300).",
