        "Cohen and Segal showed that in case there were other solutions to this problem (which appeared to be posed by Schinzel), then they should have at least 15 distinct prime factors. Moreover, there is a connection with the Lehmer's totient problem which asks whether there is a composite n such that phi(n)|(n-1). If no such composite exists, then p and 2p are the only members for Leroy's sequence. - Francisco Salinas (franciscodesalinas(AT)hotmail.com), Apr 25 2004"
