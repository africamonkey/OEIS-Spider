        "The sequence b(1)=1; b(2n) = the smallest squarefree integer > b(2n-1); b(2n+1) = the smallest power of a prime > b(2n), is such that: b(1)=a(1), b(2)=a(2), b(3)=a(3). And, b(n) = a(n+1), for n >= 4. (Ie The sequences are the same except that the integer 4 is excluded from {b(k)}, and except for the indexing after the 3rd term of each sequence.)"
