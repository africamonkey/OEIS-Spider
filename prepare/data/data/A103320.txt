        "a(4) = 444 because Golomb's sequence has three terms a(n)=4. As the sequence handles with digits, next term a(10)=1010101010 adds 5 digits \"1\", which is excluded because < a(1)=1 > states there is only one digit \"1\". Therefore a(10) and next terms are impossible and the sequence is finite."
