    "comment": [
        "\"Multiple\" is used here with two distinct meanings. The linear combination of phi and sigma must be a multiple of the argument to be tallied (Cf. A094701). There must be a multiple, i.e. at least 2, of those linear combinations for the value to be in this sequence. 3 is not in this sequence because there is only one linear combination with minimal sum, 2, viz., 1*phi(3) + 1*sigma(3), which is a multiple of 3."
    ],
    "example": [
        "2 is in the sequence because there are 3 minimal combinations of phi(2) and sigma(2), viz., 2*sigma(2), 1*phi(2) + 1*sigma(2) and 2*phi(2), all of which are multiples of 2 and all of which have coefficients totaling 2, viz., 0+2 = 1+1 = 2+0."
