For the Chebyshev S-polynomial see A049310. For rho(11) see the preceding comment. The decimal expansion of omega(11) is given in A231186. omega(11) is an integer in Q(rho(11)) with power basis coefficients [1,0,-3,0,1].

The other four X solutions are 1/rho(11), with coefficients [3,3,-4,-1,1] in the power basis of Q(rho(11)), approx. 0.52110856, 1/(2*cos(Pi*3/11)) with coefficients [-1,-1,1,0,0], approx. 0.763521119, 1/(2*cos(Pi*7/11)) with coefficients [0,-3,3,1,-1], approx. -1.20361562, and 1/(2*cos(Pi*9/11)) with coefficients [0,1,3,0,-1], approx. -0.59435114. These solutions for X are therefore irrelevant for this sequence.",
