        "The n-th term of this sequence is by definition the order of the group of admissible positions of the n X n Rubik's Square. The group is generated by 2n elements of order 2: 180-degree rotations of n columns, and 180-degree rotations of n rows. It is naturally a subgroup of the symmetric group on n^2 symbols. The sequence was discovered by Carlos Aguirre during a semester project supervised by Sean D. Lawton."

One is allowed to permute this labeling by a finite succession of 180-degree rotations of rows or columns. To compute the terms of the sequence, compute the order of the group of allowed positions. The 1 X 1 case corresponds to the trivial group and so its order is 1: the first term. Here are computations for the next three terms of this sequence using the computer program GAP:",
