        "The Heinz numbers of the partitions into parts 2,3, and 4 (including the number 1, the Heinz number of the empty partition). We define the Heinz number of a partition p = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_r] as Product(p_j-th prime, j=1...r) (concept used by Alois P. Heinz in A215366 as an \"encoding\" of a partition). For example, for the partition [2,3,3,4] the Heinz number is 3*5*5*7 = 525; it is in the sequence. - _Emeric Deutsch_ , May 21 2015"
