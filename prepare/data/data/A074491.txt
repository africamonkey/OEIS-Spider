    "comment": [
        "The usual definition of \"squarefree number\" means that there is no square as a factor of the number, but we consider \"squarefree numbers\" as those without any square in its decimal expansion (or representation). The procedure \"omit numbers with squares in their decimal expansion\" is rather severe: from 500 first primes only 68 survive and are in the sequence, while all primes are squarefree in usual sense!"

        "3557 is a member because it has no squares 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 in its decimal expansion; 3253 is a prime but contains the square 25 so it is not a member."
