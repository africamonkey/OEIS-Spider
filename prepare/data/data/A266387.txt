        "The sequence was discovered by enumerating all orbits of Aut(Z^7) and sorting the orbits as function of the infinity norm of the representative integer lattice points. This sequence is one of the 30 sequences that are obtained by classifying the orbits in a table with the rows being the infinity norm and the columns being the 30 cardinalities (1, 14, 84, 128, 168, 280, 448, 560, 672, 840, 896, 1680, 2240, 2688, 3360, 4480, 5376, 6720, 8960, 13440, 17920, 20160, 26880, 40320, 53760, 80640, 107520, 161280, 322560, 645120) generated by signed permutations of integer lattice points of Z^7.",
