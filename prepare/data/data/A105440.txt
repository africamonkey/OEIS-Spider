        "2 is definitely a \"highly cototient prime\". Oddly enough, though, PrimeFan does not list it as safe prime that is also a highly cototient number in RNTFS00013 even though he considers 1 to be a prime. - Robert Happelberg (roberthappelberg(AT)yahoo.com), Oct 04 2005.  115 of the first 229 terms (just over 50%) of A100827 are prime.
