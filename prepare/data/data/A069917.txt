        "A number n is called \"picture-perfect\" if the reversal of n equals the sum of the reversals of the proper divisors of n. These base-6 picture-perfect numbers were found by Mark Ganson while searching for (base-10) picture-perfect numbers. He observes that the digital sum of their base-10 representations = 10 and conjectures that this is the case for all base-6 picture-perfect numbers. The only (base-10) picture-perfect numbers not exceeding 1.3 * 10^9 are 6, 10311 and 21661371."

        "28 has proper divisors 1, 2, 4, 7, 14. 28 = 44_6, 1 = 1_6, 2 = 2_6, 4 = 4_6, 7 = 11_6, 14 = 22_6. Reversing these base-6 numbers, we have 44_6 = 1_6 + 2_6 + 4_6 + 11_6 + 22_6 so 28 belongs to the sequence."
