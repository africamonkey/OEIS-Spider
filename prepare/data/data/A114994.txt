        "Numbers whose binary representation avoids the sequences 110, 10100, 1001000, etc. Represents partitions. Start with empty partition and process each bit from left to right: if a zero, increase the size of the smallest part; if one, add a new size 1 part. This generates the partitions in Mathematica order. Can be regarded as a table with row lengths A000041(n); values 2^n <= a(m) < 2^(n+1) are in row n, representing the partitions of n. (Interpreting arbitrary binary numbers in this way generates compositions [also known as ordered partitions]; these are the compositions where the part sizes are in decreasing order of size.)",

        "Every number in binary is a concatenation of parts of the form 10...0 with k>=0 zeros. For example, 5=(10)(1), 11=(10)(1)(1), 7=(1)(1)(1). Define c-multiplication [*] by adding multiplicities of parts (ordering by nonincreasing numbers of 0's). For example, 5[*]3=(10)(1)(1)(1)=23. Two numbers we call equivalent if they have the same parts with the same multiplicities. So 6~5, 12~9, 14~13~11.",
        "The sequence lists equivalence classes of integers, choosing the minimal representative in each.",
        "Note that, for two terms x,y we have x[*]y=y[*]x (commutativity), and for three terms x,y,z we have x[*](y[*]z)= (x[*]y)[*]z (associativity). 0 is the unit, i.e., 0[*]x=x. Moreover, one can consider different parts, i.e., {2^n} as \"c-primes\". Then every term is a unique \"c-product\" of \"c-powers\" of c-primes. For example, 7=(1)^3, 10=(10)^2, etc.",
        "Further, one can naturally introduce \"c-notions\": c-divisor, c-divisibility, greatest common c-divisor of several numbers and least common c-multiple, Euler c-totient function (with notion of \"r is c-prime to m\"), etc.",
        "Let x[+]y denote usual sum x+y in which we order parts over nonincreasing number of zeros. Then, of course, A114994 is closed over such operation. Then a(n+1) = a(n)[+]k, where k is the least number such that a(n)[+]k > a(n). For example, since a(10)=11, we have 11[+]1=9, 11[+]2=11, 11[+]3=11, 11[+]4=15>11. So, a(11)=15.",
