        "These numbers can be used to find terms from A055744. For instance, 294 = 2 * 3 * 7^2, so for all a, b, c >= 0, all numbers of the form 294 * 2^a * 3^b * 7^c are in A055744.",
        "No two terms in this sequence can be used to find the same term from A055744 with this method, as every term in this sequence has a different set of distinct prime factors. This is because any two numbers that do not have the same set of distinct prime factors are different, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.",
