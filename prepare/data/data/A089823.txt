        "I call these primes (multiplicative) \"pointer primes\", in the sense that such primes p \"point\" to the next prime after p when the product of the digits of p is added to p. 23 is the only pointer prime < 10^7 which does not contain the digit \"1\". Are there other pointer primes not containing the digit \"1\"?",
