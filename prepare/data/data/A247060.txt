        "Players A and B bet in a k-round game. Player A has an initial amount of money n. In each round, player A can wager an integer between 0 and what he has. Player A then gains or loses an amount equal to his wager depending on whether player B lets him win or lose. Player B tries to minimize player A's money at the end. The number of rounds player A can lose is r. a(n) is the maximum amount of money player A can have at the end of the game for k = 4 and r = 1. Note that with a(0)=0, a(n+1)-a(n) is a periodic function of n with value = 1,4,3,4,4."

B will let A win, otherwise A will end up with 8 by betting all he has for the last 2 rounds. For the 3rd round, A has 4 and bets 1. B will let A win, otherwise A will end up with 6 by betting all he has at the last round. For the 4th round, A has 5 and bets 0. So A ends up with 5.
