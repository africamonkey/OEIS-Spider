    "comment": [
        "Solution to a Diophantine equation in finite fields Z/n. Historical reminder: Sophie Germain's work led to Fermat's Last Theorem being broken into two cases: x^p + y^p= z^p has no integer solutions for which x,y and z are relatively prime to p, i.e., in which none of x,y and z are divisible by p, and then x^p + y^p = z^p has no integer solutions for which one of the three numbers is divisible by p.",
        "This result was presented by Legendre in an 1823 paper to the French Academy of Sciences and included in a supplement to his second edition of Theorie des Nombres, with a footnote crediting the result to Sophie Germain. Sophie Germain's Theorem introduce an auxiliary prime n satisfying the two conditions: x^p + y^p + z^p = 0 mod (n) implies that x = 0 mod n, or y = 0 mod n, or z = 0 mod n, and x^p = p mod n is impossible for any value of x. Then Case I of Fermat's Last Theorem is true for p. This sequence give solutions for each prime number p, and n = 2p + 1."
