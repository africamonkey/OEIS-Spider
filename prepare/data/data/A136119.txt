From the definitions these conjectures are by no means obvious. Can they be proved? (_Klaus Brockhaus_, Apr 15 2008) The answer seems to be Yes - see the Cloitre link.",

        "a(n) = ceil((n-1/2)*sqrt(2)). This can be proved in the same way as the formula given for A099267. There are some generalizations. For instance, it is possible to consider \"a(n)+K*n\" instead of \"a(n)+n\" for deleting terms where K=0,1,2,...is fixed. The constant involved in the Beatty sequence for the sequence of deleted terms then depends on K and equals (K+1+sqrt((K+1)^2+4))/2. K=0 is related to A099267. 1+A001954 is the complement sequence of this sequence A136119. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Apr 18 2008"
