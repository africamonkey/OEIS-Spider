        "Let T be a set of triples (sets of three distinct points) from a set of n points. The graph G(T) has a vertex for each point, with two vertices joined by an edge if the two points belong to one of the triples. Then a(n) is the number of ways to choose T so that G(T) is connected and minimal, meaning that it becomes disconnected if any triple is omitted. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 22 2014"
