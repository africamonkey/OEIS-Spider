        "Let S = {h^6, h >=1} and T = {2*k^6, k >=1}.  Then S and T are disjoint, and their ordered union is given by A249073.  The position of n^6 is A249123(n), and the position of 2*n^6 is A249124(n).  Also, a(n) is the position of n*2^(1/6) in the joint ranking of the positive integers and the numbers k*2^(1/6), so that A249123 and A249124 are a pair of Beatty sequences."
