        "The old definition of this sequence was \"a(n) = least positive integer > a(n-1) and not equal to a(i)+a(j)+a(k) for 1<=i<=j<=k<=n\". However, Ralf Stephan observes that this does not fit the terms shown. The present definition (due to Stephan) has been adopted as a temporary solution. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 24 2004"
