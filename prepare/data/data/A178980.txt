        "\"A pictorial representation of the first 20,000 digits of [Pi] in base 2. The curve drawn goes up every time a digit is 1, and down every time it is 0. Great complexity is evident. If the curve were continued further, it would spend more time above the axis, and no aspect of what is seen provides any evidence that the digit sequence is anything but perfectly random.\" NKS."
