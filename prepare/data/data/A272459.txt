    "name": "The total number of different isosceles trapezoids, excluding squares, that can be drawn on a n X n square grid where the corners of each individual trapezoid lie on a lattice point.",
    "comment": [
        "This is an observation from a high school mathematics investigation: How many different isosceles trapezoids can be drawn on a n X n grid such that the corners of each individual trapezoid lie on a lattice point. The sequence gives the total number of different trapezoids that can be drawn.",
        "There are two \"families\" or types of trapezoids that can be drawn on a grid. The first is where the parallel sides are drawn horizontally on the grid. The second is where the parallel sides are drawn diagonally with a gradient of 1. The number in each type follow a pattern.",
        "1 X 1 grid: No trapezoids of either type can be drawn.",
        "2 X 2 grid: 1 trapezoid of type 2. One parallel side is drawn diagonally through 1 square (having length sqrt(2)) and the other is drawn diagonally through two squares (length 2*sqrt(2)). Thus, the non-parallel sides are drawn horizontally or vertically to join between the parallel sides (each length 1).",
        "3 X 3 grid: 3 trapezoids of type 1 and 4 trapezoids of type 2. The 3 trapezoids of type 1 are constructed by one parallel line drawn horizontally with length 3, the other parallel line drawn with length 1 and the perpendicular heights being successively 1, 2 and 3. Type 2 trapezoids are constructed in the same way as outlined above but with varying lengths and heights.",
        "4 X 4 grid: 8*type 1 trapezoids and 10*type 2 trapezoids.",
        "5 X 5 grid: 20*type 1 trapezoids and 20*type 2 trapezoids.",
