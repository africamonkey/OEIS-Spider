        "A number n is k-tuply abundant if it is abundant and either k = 1 or s(n) is (k-1)-tuply abundant. Thus 24 is doubly abundant: its aliquot chain is 24->36->55->17->1. a(n+1) is defined as the smallest number that is more k-tuply abundant than a(n). 966 is the last calculated term: it is 179-tuply abundant."

        "a(1) = 12 because 12 is the first abundant number.",
