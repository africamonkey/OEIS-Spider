        "Suppose that p is a partition of n.  Let x(1), x(2), ..., x(k) be the distinct parts of p, and let m(i) be the multiplicity of x(i) in p.  Let c(p) be the partition {m(1)*x(1), m(2)*x(2), ... , x(k)*m(k)} of n.  Call a partition q of n a condensed partition of n if q = c(p) for some partition p of n.  Then a(n) is the number of distinct condensed partitions of n.  Note that c(p) = p if and only if p has distinct parts and that a condensed partitions can have repeated parts."
