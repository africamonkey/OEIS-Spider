        "This sequence excludes Fibonacci numbers with odd indices, all of which are sums of two squares.",
        "Fibonacci numbers with even indices factor as F_2n = F_n L_n, L_n being n-th Lucas number. Thus F_2n factors further as F_2n = F_m L_m L_2m L_4m...L_n, with m odd. Since F_m is a sum of two squares and the pairs of Lucas numbers all have GCD dividing 2, the conclusion for F_2n depends on each Lucas number being a sum of two squares. Joint work with Kevin O'Bryant and Dennis Eichhorn.",
