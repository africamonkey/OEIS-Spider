        "As lim {n->oo} p_n/(n log n) = 1 is equivalent to the prime number theorem, a good first approximation (without having done any detailed analysis) should be a(n)=floor(log_10((10^n)*log(10^n))), which correctly generates all the first 22 terms and predicts that the sequence will continue 24,25,...,43,44,46,47,...,435,436,438,439,...,4344,4345,4347,4348,...,4503,4504 through the first 4500 terms (with only 5,45,437,4346 not appearing - compare with the digits of log_10(e) in A002285).",
        "Many terms of this sequence can be determined exactly using Dusart's bounds. The first missing terms are 5, 44, 435, 4344, 43430, 434295, 4342946, 43429449, 434294483, 4342944820, ...."
