        "864 is an element of this sequence because 864 = 2^5 * 3^3, so the sum of prime factors is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 19 which is prime, hence relatively prime to 864. That is the same sum of prime factors as 640 = 2^7 * 5, hence 640 is also a member of this sequence. The sum of prime factors need not be prime for this membership, for example, 2432 = 2^7 * 19 has sum of prime factors 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 19 = 33 = 3 * 11, which is composite, yet relatively prime to 2432."
