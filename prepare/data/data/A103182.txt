        "Note that 1/20 + 1/50 = 0.70 --> 70 is a \"sliding number\" though 0.70 is usually written 0.7 So any \"sliding number\" G produces an infinite chain of others : G*10, G*100, G*1000, etc. The first number in such a chain is called \"primitive\".",
        "Another characterization of the sliding numbers is numbers of the form a + 10^k/a where a | 10^k (k >= 0). - _David W. Wilson_, Mar 09 2005",
        "The left-hand side is (a+b)/ab and we can cancel out (a+b), so we are looking for all (a+b) with a and b positive integers, such that a*b is a (nonnegative integral) power of 10, sorted by (a+b). It follows for example that for a given k, the smallest (a+b) with that k is 2*sqrt(10^k) (equality when k i even, unless we also require a!=b). - Chris Landauer (cal(AT)rushg.aero.org), Mar 10 2005"
