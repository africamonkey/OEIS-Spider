        "There is a simple relationship between this sequence and the number of primes < primorial(p), as given by A000849 and sequence A005867 which gives the number of composites in primorial(p+1) having (p+1) as their lowest prime factor: a(n) = n + A005867(n) - A000849(n) - 1. - Dennis Martin (dennis.martin(AT)dptechnology.com), Apr 15 2007"
