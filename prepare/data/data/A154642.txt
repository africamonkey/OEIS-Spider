    "name": "a(n) is the ratio of the sum of the squares of the bends of the spheres that are added in the n-th generation of Apollonian packing of three-dimensional spheres, using \"strategy (a)\" to count them (see the reference), to the sum of the squares of the bends of the initial five mutually tangent spheres.",

        "In strategy (a) we do not count spheres that can be obtained (by reflection) from the \"extra\" quintuples of spheres that appear in the previous generation."
