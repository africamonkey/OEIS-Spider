When C = 3 and the lift starts at floor 1, what is the minimal stairs the lift must move before everyone get to the destination?",
    "example": [
        "For n = 2 the a(2) = 2 means the lift needs move only 2 stairs to transport everyone to the destination: the lift loads person at floor 1, and moves to floor 2(1 stair), unloads and loads person at floor 2, then moves to floor 1(1 stair) and unloads."
