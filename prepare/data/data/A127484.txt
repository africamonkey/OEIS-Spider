Corresponding primes of the form n^3 + (n+1)^2 are listed in A100662(n) = {5, 17, 43, 89, 593, 829, 2393, 2969, 3631, 5237, ...}. Note that there are many consecutive twins, triplets and quadruplets in A127483(n). For example: (1,2,3,4), {8,9}, {13,14,15}, {22,23,24,25}, {34,35}, {38,39}, {64,65}, {98,99,100}. Twins in A127483(k) start with numbers k = a(n). Triplets in A127483(k) start with k = {1,2,13,22,23,98,253,343,573,638,702,...} = A127485, or numbers n such that a(k) = a(k+1) - 1 = a(k+2) - 2. Quadruplets in A127483(k) start with k = {1,22,13077,14267,16092,16267,16282,36387,47012,51912,54662,...} = A127486."
