    "comment": [
        "a(n) appears to result from (alternately) intermeshing two subsequences, one of the form 11, 111, 1111,...., the other of the form 35, 351, 3513,.... In both subsequences, the current term is an initial segment of the next term. If the first k (k an even number) terms are deleted from a(n), a(n) can be reconstructed from the resulting sequence by deleting appropriate digits from the end of terms. In this sense, a(n) is self-similar."
