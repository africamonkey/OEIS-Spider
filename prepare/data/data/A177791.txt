        "Partial sums of composite number such that when sum of its prime factors is added or subtracted becomes prime. The subsequence of primes in the partial sums begins: 71, 151, 367, 1237, 1787, 3329, 5209, 8387, 9343, 13781. The subsequence of partial sums which are themselves composite number such that when sum of their prime factors is added or subtracted becomes prime, begins: 10, 51, which other such fixed points are there?"
