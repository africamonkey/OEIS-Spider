        "The \"waterfall\" sequence S for a given starting value S(1) is defined as S(n)=d(n-1)*d(n) (n>1), where d(n) is the n-th digit of the sequence.",
        "When a(0) has a digit 0 or 5, then S is likely to end up in repeating zeros, which is the motivation for the definition of this sequence."

        "The last \"2\" is obtained as 1*2 from the digits of term S(27)=12, thereafter there are no two consecutive nonzero digits and therefore only 0's can follow.",
