        "Discriminant=-408. N is an idoneal number (A000926), which means that the quadratic form's genus consists of a single class, which means that the primes of this form are identical to the primes that are congruent to c (mod 4N), where c is a set of numbers less than 4N. The sequence A139642 lists the set c for each idoneal number. That sequence also cross references the sequences for the quadratic forms with N equal to the first 36 idoneal numbers. The remaining quadratic forms are this sequence and the 28 listed in order below. Note that the sequences for N=120 and 240 are the same.",
