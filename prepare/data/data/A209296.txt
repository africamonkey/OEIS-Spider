    "comment": [
        "An unsubmitted supersequence with an initial term of value 1 and index 0 is implicitly referenced. Term k+1 in this supersequence results by adding to its k-th term the product of the smallest k primes not dividing it. Thus, each term in the sequence results by adding either the k-th primorial or the prior primorial times some prime larger than the k-th prime. To a point beyond the possibility of evaluating the primality status for the sum, only two early additions are not of primorials; and in both of these cases the next prime after the k-th is introduced.",
        "This sequence was partly motivated by considering the search for primorial primes, this being one of the simpler ways of also ensuring non-divisibility by the first so many primes.  Other than giving terms in the sum different numbers of prime factors beginning with 0, there is nothing special about starting with 1: A similar sequence may be produced with any integer starting value.",
        "Many strings of 4 or more consecutive digits the same, including six successive 8s, five successive 5s, and two same-digit quadruples very near to each other, were found noteworthy by the author in the terms calculated.",
        "The program below gives [A187750-values]:a(n):[Length] and a sentence for the exceptional adds.  A187750 holds the supersequence indices for this sequence."

    "example": [
        "a(1) = 1 + 2# = 1 + 2 = 3. Because 3 divides this and 1 + 2 + 2*5 = 13 is prime, this is a(2). a(3) = a(2) + 5# = 13 + 30 = 43. The next 3 terms in sum are 7#, 7#*13 (11 divides 43 + 7# = 253) and 13#, with a(4) resulting from the last because the 4th and 5th terms in the unsubmitted supersequence are composite."
