        "Further remarks from Jonathan R. Love (japanada11(AT)yahoo.ca), Mar 08 2007: (Start) For 2<n<10: a(9) = 16 because it can be written as 9, 4(1)4, 3(3)3, 2(5)2, or 1(7)1. All (n) can be expanded into a(n) different terms; for example, 2(5)2 can be written as 2(11111)2, 2(131)2, 2(212)2, or 2(5)2: 4 terms, since a(5) = 4. So a(9) = 1 + a(1) + a(3) + a(5) + a(7). Since a(7) = 1 + a(1) + a(3) + a(5), a(9) = a(7) + a(7) = 2 * a(7).",
        "For n=10 or 11: Using the rules for 2<n<10, a(10) would be 32, but since one of these terms is the number itself, in this case 10 and only single-digit numbers can be used, one term must be subtracted. a(10) = 2 * a(8) - 1 = 31.",
        "For 12<n<20: The same rules for 2<n<10 apply, because for 12 and up, the term taken away from 10 and 11 is added into the terms: a(12) = 62 = 2 * a(10). a(10) = 2 * a(8) - 1, so a(12) = 4 * a(8) - 2: 1 for (12) and one for 1(10)1.",
        "For 20: Including the terms subtracted in 12<n<20, another term must be subtracted for (10)(10).",
        "For 21<=n: From this point on, all possible terms are 9(a(n-18))9 + 8(a(n-16))8 + 7(a(n-14))7 + 6(a(n-12))6 + 5(a(n-10))5 + 4(a(n-8))4 + 3(a(n-6))3 + 2(a(n-4))2 + 1(a(n-2))1. If a(n-20) were to be included, it would need to be (10)(a(n-20))(10) and 10s can't be included. So everything must subtract a(n-20) from the total of 2 * a(n-2). For example, a(24) = 3956 = 2 * a(22) - a(4). (End)",
