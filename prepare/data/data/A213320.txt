        "The sequence is finite. Proof: Let p be a number >= 10^17 and let m = 9k+j be the number of digits of p, where k = floor(m/9) >= 2 and j = m mod 9. Since each 9-digit number has at least 15 nonprime substrings, it follows that p has at least 15k = 9k + 6k > 9k + j = m nonprime substrings (since 6k >= 12> j for k >= 2). Consequently, no number >= 10^17 can be a term of the sequence.",
        "The last term is a(858)=3733739. Proof: Each 9-digit number has at least 15 nonprime substrings, thus, the numbers 10^8 <= p < 10^14 also have at least 15 nonprime substrings and therefore cannot be terms of the sequence. Same is true for numbers 10^14 <= p < 10^17 since each 6-digit number has at least 4 nonprime substrings, and thus each number with >= 15 digits has at least 15+4 = 19 nonprime substrings. Since each 8-digit number has at least 10 nonprime substrings, it follows that the last term of the sequence must be less than 10^7. By direct search we find a(858) = 3733739."
