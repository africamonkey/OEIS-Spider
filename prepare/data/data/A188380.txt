        "Only terms in common with base 3 Keith numbers (A188195) for the range examined are 3 and 840.",
        "If the sum of balanced ternary digits of a positive number is 0 or less, then the recurrence from the digits soon becomes consistently negative and the number in question is not a Keith number in balanced ternary."
    ],
    "example": [
        "The number 49 in balanced ternary is {1, -1, -1, 1, 1}. The pentanacci-like sequence continues 1, 1, 3, 7, 13, 25, 49, thus 49 is a Keith number in balanced ternary."
