    "comment": [
        "It appears that this gives the number of Ramanujan primes < 10^n that are the lesser prime in a twin prime pair. Equivalently, this sequence also gives the number of Ramanujan primes p with p+2 also prime less than 10^n.",
        "It appears that no upper twin prime is a Ramanujan prime without the corresponding lower twin prime also being a Ramanujan prime.",
        "This is proved in Section 4 of \"Ramanujan Primes: Bounds, Runs, Twins, and Gaps\"."
