        "These elements form a subgroup in A089840 (A089839). Because A127301 can be computed as a fold and most of the recursive derivations of A089840 (i.e. tables A122201-A122204, A122283-A122290, A130400-A130403) are also folds, this sequence gives also the indices to those derived tables where bijections preserving A127301 occur."
