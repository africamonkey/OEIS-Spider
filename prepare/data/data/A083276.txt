        "This differs from A057745 at 6 ply and above because where an en passant capture would be illegal, the position is essentially the same as where an en passant capture is not available. It is two less than A057745 at 6 ply because the positions after 1. f4 e6/e5 2. Kf2 Qf6 3. f5 g5 are considered to be the same as after 1. f4 g5 2. Kf2 e6/e5 3. f5 Qf6.",
