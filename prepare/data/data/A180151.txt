        "\"5-almost primes\" that keep that property when incremented by 2. This sequence is to 5 as 4 is to A180150, as 3 is to A180117, as A092207 is to 2, and as A001359 is to 1. That is, this sequence is the 5th row of the infinite array A[k,n] = n-th natural number m such that m and m+2 are both divisible by exactly k primes (counted with multiplicity). The first row is the lesser of twin primes. The second row is the sequence such that m and m+2 are both semiprimes."
