        "The first occurrence of a sequence that doesn't define a tournament happens for n = 5. There are two such sequences {1,1,2,3,3} and {1,2,2,2,3}. Let's consider the first sequence: {1,1,2,3,3}. Let's take the two best players - the persons with 3 wins - as one of them should win the game with another, there is only one other person who won a game with one of the two best players. It could happen that this player has score 1 or 2. Thus we can get two different tournaments with the same score vector."
