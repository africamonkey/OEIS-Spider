    "comment": [
        "It seems that to obtain this sequence we need to impose two additional rules: 1. x-y is allowed only when x-y > 0 (which also applies to A060274). 2. \"Allowing concatenation of the digits\" *only* applies to the base digits, 1 and 2, not to the decimal representations of subexpression values. So for example, 13 cannot be obtained via: 13 = 1 concat 3 = 1 concat (1+2) because \"3\" is not a string consisting solely of 1's or 2's, but can be obtained via: 13 = 11 + 2 = (1 concat 1) + 2. Then the example 151 really does have complexity 7 under this measure."
