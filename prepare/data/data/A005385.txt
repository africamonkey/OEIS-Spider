        "A prime p of the form 6k+1, k >= 2, i.e., p = 1 (mod 6), cannot be a safe prime since (p-1)/2 is composite and divisible by 3. (End)",

        "When the n-th prime is divided by all primes up to the (n-1)-th prime, safe primes (p) have remainders of 1 when divided by 2 and (p-1)/2 and no other primes. That is, p(mod j)=1 iff j={2,(p-1)/2}; p>j, {p,j}=>prime.  Explanation: Generally, x(mod y)=1 iff x=y'+1, where y' is the set of divisors of y, y'>1. Since safe primes (p) are of the form p(mod j)=1 iff p and j are prime, then j={j'}. That is, since j is prime, there are no divisors of j (greater than 1) other than j.  Therefore, no primes other than j exist which satisfy the equation p(mod j)=1.",
        "Except primes of the form 2^n+1 (n>=0), all non-safe primes (p') will have at least one prime (p\") greater than 2 and less than (p-1)/2 such that p'(mod p\")=1. Explanation: Non-safe primes (p') are of the form p'(mod k)=1 where k is composite. This means prime divisors of k exist, and p\" is the set of prime divisors of k (example p'=89: k=44; p\"={2,11}).  The exception applies because p\"={2} iff p'=2^n+1.",
