        "The values of A(k) are in sequence A138474. The least order N(k) of the cyclotomic polynomial producing A(k) is A138475(k). For k >= a(n), computational experiments have shown that only primes >= prime(n) divide N(k). These terms were determined empirically; is there another way of characterizing these numbers?"
