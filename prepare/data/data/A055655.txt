        "Efficient means the smallest possible a(n), cf. example. From n = 9*9+8*4+3 = 116 on, the terms (coded in base 10) become ambiguous because digits may be larger than 9, e.g., 1000 could mean 1*16 or 10*9. One possible convention to avoid ambiguity would be to reserve as many digits as might be required for the largest possible coefficient: 2 digits for the coefficients of 9 (which may reach 16-1 = 15) through 81; 3 digits for the coefficients of 100 through 30^2, 4 digits for the coefficients of 31^2 (which may reach 32^2-1 = 1023) etc. - _M.
