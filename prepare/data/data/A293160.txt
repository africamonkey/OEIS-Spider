        "Equivalently, a(n) is the number of distinct terms in row n of the Stern-Brocot sequence (A002487) when that sequence is divided into blocks of lengths 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...",
        "It would be nice to have a formula or recurrence, or even some bounds. Empirically, a(n) seems to be roughly 2^(2n/3) for the known values. Note that the first half of row n has about 2^(n-2) terms, and the maximal multiplicity is given by A293957(n), so 2^(n-2)/A293957(n) is a lower bound on a(n), which seems not too bad for the known values. - _N.
