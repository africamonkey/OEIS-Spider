    "comment": [
        "A finite number of orbits partition hypercubic shells of infinity norm s in the n-dimensional integer lattice. The number of orbits is given by C(n+s-1,s). The number of distinct cardinalities of the orbits of lattice points under the automorphism group of the n-dimensional integer lattice is found under the condition that n <= s."

    "example": [
        "For n=0 the a(0)=1. For n=3 we have the following distinct cardinalities of the orbits 6, 8, 12, 24, 48 and thus a(3)=5. For n=4 we have the distinct cardinalities of the orbits 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 192, 384 and thus a(4)=9. For n=5 we have the distinct cardinalities of the orbits 10, 32, 40, 160, 240, 320, 480, 640, 960, 1920, 3840 and thus a(5)=12."
