        "Clearly A232779 is increasing, and A232779(n) equals 1 + A232779(n - 1) unless n is a power of 2. Therefore this sequence consists of all numbers strictly between A232779(2^r - 1) and A232779(2^r) for some r. For example, A232779(15) = 15 + 3 + 1 = 19, whereas A232779(16) = 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 23, so this sequence includes the terms 20, 21, 22.",
