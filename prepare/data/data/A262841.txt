        "The tree T, which we call the Fibonacci zero tree, is generated by these rules: (0, 0) is in T, and if (0, h) is in T, then (0, h + 1) is in T, and if (k, 0) is in T, then (0, k*x) is in T. The number of vertices (f(x),g(x)) in the n-th generation of T is F(n+1), where F = A000045, the Fibonacci numbers, for n >= 0.",
