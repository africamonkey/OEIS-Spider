        "Also, apart from the first term a(0)=1, the number of terms in A179016 whose binary width is n+2 bits and whose second most significant bit is zero. For example, there is one term 4 (100) in three-bit range; two terms 8 (1000) and 11 (1011) in four bit range; three such terms: 16 (10000), 19 (10011) and 23 (10111) in five-bit range; five terms: 32, 35, 39, 42, 46 in six-bit range. This stems from the half-recursive nature of A179016, especially, that for all n >= 4, a(n) gives also the number of steps to go from (2^(n+1) + 2^n + 1) to 2^n using the iterative process described in A071542.
