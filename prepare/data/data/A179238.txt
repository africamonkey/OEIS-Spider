Example: Given a right triangle with sides a = 3, b = 5, c = sqrt(34), we calculate the two acute angles 2A and divide each by two, giving us two angles A; then perform tan(A) on each. These have an algebraic equivalency of two constants: 3/(5 + sqrt(34)) = 0.276983964... and 5/(3 + sqrt(34)) = 0.566190378... The continued fraction representations of these constants are respectively barover[3,1,1,1,1,3] and barover[1,1,3,3,1,1], both palindromic. The conjecture and proof don't apply to Pythagorean triangles, in which case the tangents of the half angles would be rational. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 07 2014"
