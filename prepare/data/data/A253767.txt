        "Also, total number of ON cells after n generations in a three-dimensional cellular automaton where A247666(n) gives the number of ON cells in the n-th level of the structure starting from the top. An ON cell remains ON forever. An ON cell is an hexagonal prism of height 1. We start with a single ON cell. The structure looks like an irregular step pyramid, apparently with a like-hexagonal base."
