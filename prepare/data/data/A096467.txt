        "Here a primitive Heronian triangle has integer sides a,b,c with GCD(a,b,c) = 1 and integral area. Note that all primes of the form 4k+1 are in this sequence. It appears that a prime of the form 4k+3 is never the longest side of a Heronian triangle. Cheney's article contains many theorems about these triangles."
