        "Computing and storing the indices of lower or upper twin primes is useful in computing twinl(n) or the n-th lower twin prime from a large file of primes."
    ],
    "formula": [
        "Every prime has an index denoting the position the prime is in the sequence 1,2,3,... For example, 5 is the 3rd prime number so 5 has index 3, 3 has index 2 etc. It is when an upper twin prime's lower member has an index that is also prime that we list the upper prime."
    ],
    "example": [
        "13 is the upper twin prime of the pair 11,13. The lower member 11 is the 5th prime number and the index 5 is prime so 13 is in the table."
