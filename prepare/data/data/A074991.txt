        "If all the three numbers have the same number of digits then the terms are in A.P. with a common difference that follows a pattern with increase in number of digits. E.g. for n = 1 to 7 the common difference, c.d. = 37. For n = 10 to 97 c.d. = 3367, For three digit numbers from 100 to 997 it is 333667 etc."
