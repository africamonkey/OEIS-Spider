        "Questions: (1) Is this sequence infinite? (2) Are the gaps between the elements of this sequence bounded from above? (3) If this sequence is infinite, what is its asymptotic growth? (4) Consider the definition of this sequence for other values c instead of the golden ratio. What are the properties of this modified sequence?"
