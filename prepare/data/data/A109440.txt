Let \"CompP\" be the set of composite partition points {p,q} corresponding to n such that n = p + q, p is prime, q is composite and p <= q. Let \"AllP\" be the (disjoint) union of the sets PrimeP and CompP. Let \"LPrimeP\", \"LCompP\" and \"LAllP\" denote the lengths of the sets = PrimeP, CompP and AllP, respectively. Sequence gives values of n such that LPrimeP=LCompP.",
