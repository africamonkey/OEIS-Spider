    "comment": [
        "Empirically, the limit of a(n)/10^n tends to 3/Pi^2 (A104141) and implies that the asymptotic density of squarefree numbers congruent to {5, 6, 7} mod 8 is half that of the asymptotic density of all squarefree integers (A071172). There is a slight bias towards more squarefree numbers congruent to {5, 6, 7} mod 8 that can be argued heuristically as {1, 2, 3} mod 8 contains a square residue and its equivalence class should contain less squarefree numbers.",
        "Also it has been shown, conditional on the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, that all squarefree integers congruent to {5, 6, 7} mod 8 (A273929) are primitive (squarefree) congruent numbers (A006991). However, this property applies only sparsely to squarefree integers congruent to {1, 2, 3} mod 8 (A062695)."
