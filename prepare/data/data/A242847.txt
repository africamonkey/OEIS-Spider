        "The sequence is infinite, in view of a strong closeness between counting functions of numbers N_1 for which lpf(N_1-3) > lpf(N_1-1) >= prime(n) and numbers N_2 for which lpf(N_2-1) > lpf(N_2-3) >= prime(n), if {N_2-3, N_2-1} is not a pair of twin primes, where p_n=prime(n) and lpf=least prime factor (A020639). (Cf., for example, A243803-A243804). This closeness is explained by a somewhat symmetry (for details, see Shevelev's link).",
        "However, it is very interesting to find an analytical proof of infinity of this and complementory sequences."
