        "If 2^n-3 is prime (n is a term of A050414) then 2^(n-1)*(2^n-3) is in the sequence, this fact is a result of the following interesting theorem that I have found. Theorem: If k is an integer and 2^n-(2k+1) is prime then 2^(n-1)*(2^n-(2k+1)) is a solution of the equation sigma(x)=2(x+k). - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Feb 23 2005",
        "Note that the fact \" if 2^p-1 is prime then 2^(p-1)*(2^p-1) is a perfect number \" is also a trivial result of this theorem. All known terms of this sequence are of the form 2^(n-1)*(2^n-3) where 2^n-3 is prime. Conjecture: There are no term of other forms. So likely next terms of this sequence are: 549754241024,8796086730752,140737463189504,144115187270549504, 2^93*(2^94-3),2^115*(2^116-3),2^121*(2^122-3),2^149*(2^150-3) and etc. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Feb 23 2005",
        "The conjecture in the previous comment is incorrect. The first counterexample is 650, which has factorization 2*5^2*13. - _T. D. Noe_, May 10 2010",
        "One might call these the \"slightly more excessive numbers\", by comparison with quasiperfect numbers, called \"slightly excessive numbers\" by Singh (1997), which are \"least\" abundant number, i.e., one such that sigma[n]-2n=+1, and for which there are none <10^35. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, May 01 2011",
