        "This sequence counts dissections of a convex 3n+3-sided polygon into one triangle and n pentagons, modulo a simple equivalence relation. This equivalence relation is defined by moving the triangle according to a simple rule (not detailed here).",
        "(The equivalence relation is not defined by a group, but by local moves. Consider the hexagon formed by a pentagon adjacent to the triangle. The local move is half-rotation of such hexagons.)"
