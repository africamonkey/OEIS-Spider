        "The sequence is infinite.",
        "Creation of the Sequence. The sequence was generated based on the following known results for primitive Pythagorean triples/triangles (PPTs).",
        "Let c represent the hypotenuse of a PPT and a, b be its sides. Without loss of generality, let a be the odd side and b be the even side.",
        "(a) c takes the form 4n+1.",
        "(b) One of a,b,c is divisible by 5.",
        "Let c be divisible by 5. Thus, this sequence represents the palindromic hypotenuse of a PPT that is divisible by 5.",
        "With the exception of 5, the last two digits of each term of this sequence are 05, 25, 45, 65 or 85. Thus, since the terms are palindromes, the first two digits of each term of the sequence are 50, 52, 54, 56 or 58.",
        "Proof. If k is an element of the sequence, then its form must be 4n+1 for some integer n. This means that k-1=4n that is, k-1 is divisible by 4. Since an integer is divisible by 4 if and only if the number composed of its last two digits is divisible by 4, it must be that the number composed of the last two digits of k-1 is divisible by 4. With this we get the desired result.",
