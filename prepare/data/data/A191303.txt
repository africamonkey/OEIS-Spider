        "For the definition of k-digit half-palindromes, see A191279. Although there exist infinitely many polynomials taking only 3-digit half-palindrome values (see comment to A191279), only two polynomials are known with all values 4-digit half-palindromes. They are the polynomials P(n) which were discovered in SeqFan Discussion list from Mar 14 2011 and its double.",
