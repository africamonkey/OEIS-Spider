        "60 has 8 unitary divisors (1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 15, 20 and 60). Primes 3 and 5 have the same prime signature, as do 12 (2^2*3) and 20 (2^2*5); each of the other four numbers listed is the only unitary divisor of 60 with its particular prime signature.  This makes a total of 6 distinct prime signatures that appear among the unitary divisors of 60.  Since no positive integer smaller than 60 has more than 4 distinct prime signatures appearing among its unitary divisors, 60 belongs to this sequence."
