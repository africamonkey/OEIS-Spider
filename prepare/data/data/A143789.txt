    "comment": [
        "\"Lightest\" --> the weight of such a sequence is the sum of all its terms; \"Finite\" --> by definition all such sequences are finite; \"Monotonically\" --> no two adjacent terms in the sequence are the same; \"Increasing\" --> a(n) < a(n+1); \"Chunking\" --> cutting in slices. The original Skolem-Langford number is 456784151637283200 [this is a(14565) in \"D. Wilson, Complete table of n, a(n) for n = 1..20120\", which can be found at A108116] and this integer, properly chunked, produces the sequence]. In the sequence there is no digit between the two 0's, there is one digit between the two 1's, there are two digits between the two 2's,... there are eight digits between the two 8's. This sequence has been computed by _Dan Hoey_."
