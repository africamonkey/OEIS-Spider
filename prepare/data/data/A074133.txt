        "The lexicographically earliest possibility satisfying the requirement is to be considered. This practically means that the k-th group consists in the k-1 smallest numbers not yet used, followed the next smallest unused number which completes their sum to a multiple of k. - M. F. Hasler, May 07 2010",
        "Original definition (The given example seems wrong from \"23\" on. [Z. Seidov & MFH]): Rearrange the natural numbers in groups so that the n-th group contains n terms and the sum is a multiple of n: (1), (2, 4), (3, 5, 7), (6, 8, 9, 13), (10, 11, 12, 14, 23), (15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 29), (20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30), (27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36), ... Sequence gives sum of the terms/ n for the n-th group (the average of the group).",
        "In the k-th group the first (k-1) terms are partly all the numbers not included earlier followed by numbers in increasing order and then the k-th term is chosen so that the sum is a multiple of k."
