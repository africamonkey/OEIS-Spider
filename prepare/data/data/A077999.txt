        "a(n) = number of permutations on [n] that avoid nonconsecutive instances of the patterns 321 and 312. For example, a(4) does not count pi=4231 because 431 forms a 321 pattern in pi but 431 is not a consecutive (that is, contiguous) string in pi; also, the first 3 letters form a 312 pattern but that's not disqualifying because they do occur consecutively. Counting these permutations by various statistics yields the listed formulas/recurrences. - _David Callan_, Oct 26 2006",
