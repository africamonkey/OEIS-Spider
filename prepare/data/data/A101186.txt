        "The number (7m+1)(8m+1)(11m+1) is a 3-factor Carmichael number if and only if m is equal to 1848k+942 with k in this sequence. The sequence includes the value k=10^329-4624879 which yields a 1000-digit Carmichael number with three prime factors of 334 digits each. Other Carmichael numbers of the same form would necessarily have 4 prime factors or more; the smallest such example is 3664585=127*(7*29)*199, for m=18."

Pinch, this one features the largest \"least prime factor\")."
