        "The smallest numbers k having n prime divisors are 128, 162, 3600, 558144, ... .",
        "It is possible to find numbers where this property can be repeated, for example: 31250000 -> (31250000, 125000) -> (125000, 2500) -> (2500, 50) and these numbers have the same prime divisors 2 and 5.",
        "More generally, it is possible to find pairs of numbers (x, y) of the form x = x(0)Ax(q) and y = y(0)By(q), x < y, with the same prime divisors such that B = p*A where A and B are the numbers representing the middle digits of x and y, and p is a prime divisor of x and y. Example: (a(67), a(70)) = (1263168, 1789488) have the same prime divisors {2,3,17,43} and 78948 = 3*26316."
