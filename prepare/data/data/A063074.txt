        "Also the number of subsets of {1,..,4n} containing exactly 2n elements with total sum n*(4n+1) (see also A060468 for a related sequence). This is of course the same as the number of partitions of n*(4n+1) having 2n distinct parts of length at most 4n. This number is the coefficient of t^0 q^0 in the product('(t*q^k+1/(t*q^k)','k'=1..4*n). - _Roland Bacher_, May 02 2002",
