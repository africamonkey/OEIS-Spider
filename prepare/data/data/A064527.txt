        "The list contains all numbers of the form 2^w*3^u for w> 0, u>=0. But it also contains 120, 200, 240 and 400. It contains n! for all n because the symmetric groups have integral character tables. By taking direct products, we get all numbers of the form n! * 2^w * 3^u, w > 0, u >= 0. The 200 comes from a semidirect product of an elementary group of order 25 with a quaternion group of order 8, with fixed-point-free action (a Frobenius group). - Derek Holt",
