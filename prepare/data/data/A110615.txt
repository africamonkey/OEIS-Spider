        "a(13)=35=2E since no earlier composite is of the form \"*2*E*\". The list of minimal composites can be constructed using a sieve-like process: subsequently eliminate from the list of composites all composites of the form \"*2*E*\". Assuming all previous terms have been similarly determined, then the next remaining composite should be 30."
