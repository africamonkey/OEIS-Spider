        "If c(2) is even then c(k) = 1 for k >= 2*c(2), hence there's no even value in the sequence. If n is in the sequence, there's an integer k(n) and an integer m(n), such that for any k >= k(n) c(2k)-c(2k-1) = 2*m(n) and c(2k+1)-c(2k)=-m(n). Sometime m(n) = (n-1)/2 but not always. If B(n) = a(n+1)-a(n) then B(n) = 2 or 4 only, but B(n) doesn't seem follow any pattern.",
