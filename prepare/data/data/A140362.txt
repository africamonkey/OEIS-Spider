        "Using Pell equations and a Fibonacci identity, Max Alekseyev and I have shown that all terms are the product of prime Fibonacci numbers whose indices are twin primes. The first three terms are Fib(3)*Fib(5), Fib(5)*Fib(7) and Fib(11)*Fib(13). The other two known terms are Fib(431)*Fib(433) and Fib(569)*Fib(571), huge numbers that are in the b-file. The sequence probably has no additional terms. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 27 2008",
        "Let a, b, c and d be consecutive odd-index Fibonacci numbers. Then it can be proved that 1 + b^2 + c^2 + (bc)^2 = abcd, which shows that bc divides 1 + b^2 + c^2 + (bc)^2. Hence if b and c are prime, then bc is in this sequence. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 27 2008"
