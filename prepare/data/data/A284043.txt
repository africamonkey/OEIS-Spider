        "This sequence is inspired by the problem proposed by Sidney Kravitz in 1963: \"It is known that f(n)=n^2-n+41 yields prime numbers for n=1, 2, ..., 40. Find a sequence of 40 consecutive values of n for which f(n) is composite.\" Lawrence A. Ringenberg and others suggested the solution that starts at f(1)*f(2)*...*f(40)+1 (about 4.890... * 10^101). B. A. Hausmann suggested the smaller solution that starts at f(1)*f(2)*...*f(20)-19 (about 3.213... * 10^42). The smallest solution is a(40) = 1081297."
