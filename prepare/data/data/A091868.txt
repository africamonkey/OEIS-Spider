        "Also, number of ways to assemble an n-simplex from n+1 labeled (n-1)-simplices with labeled vertices, where left-handed and right-handed counterparts are considered equivalent.",
        "For n=2, we are constructing a triangle from 3 labeled line-segments with labeled endpoints. Solutions which differ by a rotation or a reflection are considered equivalent. Because reflections are equivalent, there is only 1 way to order the line-segments, and each line-segment can be oriented in 2 ways, so the total number of solutions is 2^3 = 8. For n=3, we are constructing a tetrahedron from 4 labeled triangles with labeled vertices. Without loss of generality, we can pick one labeled triangle to serve as our face of reference. For this face, we do not care which side of the triangle will face the interior of the tetrahedron as this just translates into a reflection of the tetrahedron, nor do we care about which rotation we pick as these just translate into rotations of the tetrahedron. From this reference triangle, there are 6 (=3!) ways to assign the remaining triangles to the faces of the tetrahedron, and each triangle can be oriented in 6 (=3!) ways (we can pick which side of the triangle will face the interior of the tetrahedron, and we can pick from 3 rotations). This gives 6^4 solutions.",
