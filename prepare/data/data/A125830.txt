        "This sequence is equal to 13, 31, A006562, A117876, A118467, ..., A125623, ... Let p(n) denote the n-th prime. If 2 p(n) - p(n+1) is a prime, say p(n-i) and if p(n) has a level 1 in A117563, then we say that p(n) has level(1,i). Primes of level (1,1) form the sequence A006562. 13 and 31 have a level 1 but not sub-level i."
