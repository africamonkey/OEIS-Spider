        "A134419 consists of those n where x^2 - n*y^2 = n(n-1)(n+1)/3 has integer solutions for x and y. There are easily verified necessary congruence conditions for that to occur:",
        "  (defining x||y to mean x|y and x and y/x are coprime)",
        "  if 3^e||n with e>0, then e is odd and (n/3^e)=2 (mod 3);",
        "  if p^e||n with p=5 or 7 (mod 12), then e is even;",

        "If n = k^2*m where m is squarefree, then a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for n to occur in this sequence is that the narrow class group of quadratic forms of discriminant 4*m has more than one class per genus, or equivalently that the narrow class group is not an elementary 2-group."
