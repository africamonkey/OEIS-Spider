        "The n-th term is the number of notes of the (2n-1)-limit tonality diamond. This is a term from music theory and means the scale consisting of the rational numbers r, 1 <= r < 2, such that the odd part of both the numerator and the denominator of r, when reduced to lowest terms, is less than or equal to the fixed odd number 2n-1. - _Gene Ward Smith_, Mar 27 2006",
