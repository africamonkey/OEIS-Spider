        "The word \"above\" in the definition is somewhat ambiguous. More precisely, this is the list of n such that A065188(n) >= n.",
        "If one looks at the graph of A065188, the points appear to lie roughly on two lines, of slopes phi (the golden ratio) and 1/phi. The points in the present sequence appear to fall on the line of slope phi. That is, it is appears that A065188(a(n))/a(n) -> phi as n -> oo."
