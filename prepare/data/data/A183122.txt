        "A.   The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the presented sequence is NOT optimal. The particular \"62\" algorithm solving the puzzle at hand is presented and discussed in the paper referenced by link 1 below. For the optimal solution of the Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the given pre-coloring configuration (the \"natural\" or \"free\" Magnetic Tower) see A183117 and A183118. Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",

        "C.   The above-listed \"original\" sequence generates a \"partial-sums\" sequence - describing the total number of moves required to solve the puzzle.",
        "D.   Number of moves of disk k, for large k, is close to (67/108)*3^(k-1) ~ 0.62*3^(k-1). Series designation: P62(k)."
