    "comment": [
        "A combinatorial configuration of type (n_3) consists of an (abstract) set of n points together with a set of n triples of points, called lines, such that each point belongs to 3 lines and each line contains 3 points.",
        "Interchanging the roles of points and lines gives the dual configuration. A configuration is self-dual if there is an isomorphism from it to its dual."
