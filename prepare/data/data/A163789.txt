        "Place the numbers 1..N (N>=2) on a circle and cyclicly mark the 9th unmarked number until all N numbers are marked. The order in which the N numbers are marked defines a permutation; N is a J_9-prime if this permutation consists of a single cycle of length N.",
        "There are 9 J_9-primes in the interval 2..1000000 only. No formula is known; the J_9-primes have been found by exhaustive search."
