    "comment": [
        "Unlike any of the prime number races in which any particular form may lead or trail, this sequence demonstrates that although the count of numbers having k prime factors begins by trailing those which have k-1 prime factors, eventually their numbers will exceed those of the other. This can be seen by looking at A126279 or A126280.",
        "The fundamental theorem of arithmetic, or unique factorization theorem, states that every natural number greater than one either is itself a prime number, or can be written as a unique product of prime numbers. It had a proof sketched by Euclid, then corrected and completed in \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" [Carl Friedrich Gauss, 1801]. It fails in many rings of algebraic integers [Ernst Kummer, 1843], a discovery initiating algebraic number theory. Counting the elements in the unique product of prime numbers classifies natural numbers into prime, semiprimes, trieneprimes and so on. This sequence quantifies a previously undescribed structure to that classification.",
        "We took the first k where the two almost prime counts are the same. If instead we took the least k such that the n-th-almost prime count always exceeds the (n-1)th-almost prime. That sequence would begin: 3,34,15530,...,.",
