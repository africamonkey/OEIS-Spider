        "All digits are composite. Each term ends with the digit '9'. Since each term is prime, it never serves as the suffix of any subsequent term; e.g., no term beyond 89 ends with the digits '89', so the only remaining allowed two-digit endings are '49', '69', and '99'; no terms beyond 449 and 499 end with '449' or '499' (and '899' is ruled out because of 89), so the only remaining allowed three-digit endings are '469', '649', '669', '699', '849', '869', '949', '969', and '999' (and each of these appears as the ending of at least one four-digit term, except '999', which doesn't appear as the ending of any term until a(75) = 4696999). - _Jon E.
