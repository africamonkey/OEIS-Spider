        "Except for p=5, the decimals in A092110 end in 3 or 7.",
        "Theorem: If in the triple (2n-3,n,2n+3) all numbers are primes then n=5 or the decimal representation of n ends in 3 or 7. Proof: Consider Q=(2n-3)n(2n+3), by hypothesis factorized into primes. If n is prime, n=10k+r with r=1,3,7 or 9. We want to exclude r=1 and r=9. Case n=10k+1. Then Q=5(-1+6k+240k^2+800k^3) and 5 is a factor; thus 2n-3=5 or n=5 or 2n+1=5 : this means n=4 (not prime); or n=5 (included); or n=2 (impossible, because 2n-3=1). Case n=10k+9. Then Q=5(567+1926k+2160k^2+800k^3) and 5 is a factor; the arguments, for the previous case, also hold."
