        "If n=2^k-1, where either k=1, or n is a Mersenne prime (A000668), or sigma(n)=3*2^(k-1), then n is in the sequence; are there any terms not of these forms? The last form includes the terms 15 and 1023; are there others like this?",
        "Is this sequence infinite?",
        "It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes. So this conjecture also supports that this sequence is infinite. Additionally, if n=2^k-1, where either k=1, or n is a Mersenne prime (A000668), or sigma(n)=3*2^(k-1), then A000217(n) divides sigma(A000217(n)). - _Altug Alkan_, Jul 25 2016"
