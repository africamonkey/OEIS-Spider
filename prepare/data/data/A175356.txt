        "A \"run\" of 0's is not immediately bounded by any 0's, and a \"run\" of 1's is not immediately bounded by any 1's.",
        "There are exactly (m(m+1)/2)!/product{k=1 to m}k! numbers in the sequence each of m^3/3 +m^2/2 +m/6 binary digits, for all m >= 1, and none of any other number of binary digits."

        "9016 in binary is 10001100111000. There is exactly one run of one binary digit, two runs of two binary digits, and three runs of three binary digits. (Note that it doesn't matter if the runs are of 0's or of 1's.) So, 9016 is in the sequence."
