        "The sequence A175545 (numbers n such that the decimal form of the period of 1/n is prime) is only concerned with numbers n such that gcd(n,10)=1. Each number n such that gcd(n,10)<>1 generates a quotient where there exist a sequence of digits which is periodic after a finite sequence of digits, for example 1/36 = .0277777.... and 7 is periodic.",
