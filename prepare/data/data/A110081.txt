    "comment": [
        "All nonnegative reals can be represented with ternary digits 0, 1, 2. If you're not allowed to use 2, then you only get something like the Cantor set. But you're back in business if you're allowed to use 0, 1, -1 - this gives the \"balanced\" ternary representation (so 1 is in the sequence).",
        "The sequence is known to be infinite and irregular and is conjectured to have density zero."
