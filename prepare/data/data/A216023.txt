        "(2) the sum of their prime factors is divisible by 5 (1105, 1905, 16705, 18705, 34945, 223345, 757945, 800605).",
        "(3) the sum of their digits is divisible by 5 (645, 1905, 11305, 34945, 72885, 208465, 72885);",
        "(4) they are Harshad numbers (645, 1905, 2465, 223345, 757945).",
        "Interesting is that the first property is found to other sguarefree numbers, not Fermat pseudoprimes, divisible by 5 (e.g. for 1505 = 5*7*43 we have 55 divisible by 11, for 2555 = 5*7*73 we have 85 divisible by 17). Looks like it\u2019s a property which deserves further studies.",
        "Note: the four properties from above are also found to other Fermat pseudoprimes to base 2, but not in this high density (taking, for the second and third properties, a prime factor beside 5 and not considering for the third property the prime factor 3, because would be obviously satisfied)."
