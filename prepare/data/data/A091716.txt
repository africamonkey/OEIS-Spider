        "It appears that a good estimate for the standard deviation of primes below 10^(n+1) is about 10 times the term for 10^n.",
        "Heuristically, if we use a model where each positive integer x has probability approximately 1/log(x) of being prime, we should expect the standard deviation of the primes below N to be approximately N/sqrt(12). - _Robert Israel_, Sep 23 2014"
