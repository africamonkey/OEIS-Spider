    "comment": [
        "Powers of 2 are not expressible as sums of two primes from this sequence. This attains by more economical algorithm than for construction of A152451. If A(x) is the counting function for the terms a(n)<=x, then A(x)=pi(x)-O(x/(log^2(x)). It is known that the approximation pi(x) by x/log(x) gives the remainder term as best O(x/log^2(x)). Therefore beginning our process from m>=M (with arbitrary large M), we obtain a sequence which essentially is indistinguishable from the sequence of all odd primes with help of the approximation of pi(x) by x/log(x). Hence it is in principle impossible to prove the binary Goldbach conjecture by such approximation of pi(x)."
