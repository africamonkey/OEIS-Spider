        "Theory. (Start)",
        "1. Definitions. Let T_(9,j,0) denote the rhombus with sides of unit length (=1), interior angles given by the pair (j*Pi/9,(9-j)*Pi/9) and Area(T_(9,j,0))=sin(j*Pi/9), j in {1,2,3,4}. Associated with T_(9,j,0) are its angle coefficients (j, 9-j) in which one coefficient is even while the other is odd. A half-tile is created by cutting T_(9,j,0) along a line extending between its two corners with even angle coefficient; let H_(9,j,0) denote this half-tile. Similarly, a T_(9,j,r) tile is a linearly scaled version of T_(9,j,0) with sides of length Q^r and Area(T_(9,j,r))=Q^(2*r)*sin(j*Pi/9), r>=0 an integer, where Q is the positive, constant square root Q=sqrt(x^2-1) with x=2*cos(Pi/9); likewise let H_(9,j,r) denote the corresponding half-tile. Often H_(9,i,r) (i in {1,2,3,4}) can be subdivided into an integral number of each equivalence class H_(9,j,0). But regardless of whether or not H_(9,j,r) subdivides, in theory such a proposed subdivision for each j can be represented by the matrix M=(m_(i,j)), i,j=1,2,3,4, in which the entry m_(i,j) gives the quantity of H_(9,j,0) tiles that should be present in a subdivided H_(9,i,r) tile. The number Q^(2*r) (the square of the scaling factor) is an eigenvalue of M=(U_2)^r, where",

Note that D_r-3*D_(r-1)+3*D_(r-3)={0,0,0,0}, for r>=4, with initial conditions {D_k}={{0,0,0,1},{0,1,1,1},{1,2,2,3},{2,5,6,7}}, k=0,1,2,3. Let p={p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4}={-2,0,1,2} and n=3*r+p_i. Then a(n)=a(3*r+p_i)=m_(i,4), where M=(m_(i,j))=(U_2)^r was defined above. Hence the block D_r corresponds component-wise to the fourth column of M, and a(3*r+p_i)=m_(i,4) gives the quantity of H_(9,4,0) tiles that should appear in a subdivided H_(9,i,r) tile. (End)",

        "Since U_2 is symmetric, so is M=(U_2)^r, so the block D_r also corresponds to the fourth row of M. Therefore, alternatively, for j=1,2,3,4, a(3r+p_j)=m_(4,j) gives the quantity of H_(9,j,0) tiles that should be present in a H_(9,4,r) tile.",
