        "A twin pack of primes contains 2 or more pairs of twin primes, between which pairs there are no other primes. 9419,9421,9431,9433,9437,9439,9461,9463 are in the sequence because they are consecutive primes which belong to more than 3 twin pairs. 137,139,149,151 are not because they belong to a pack of only 2 pairs.",
