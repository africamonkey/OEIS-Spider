        "There are no primes in the sequence, as the prime p fails the base p test. The set of positive integers failing the base p test for membership has density 1/p. Also, when n is a nonmember of the set, any base p whose test n fails has p<=n. Therefore one conjectural estimate for the number of members of the set <=x would be x*product{primes p<=x}(1-1/p) ~ e^(-gamma)*x/log(x). However, a similar heuristic for the primes fails, as pi(x) ~ x/log(x) and not e^(-gamma)*x/log(x). Here gamma denotes the Euler-Mascheroni constant. - _David L. Harden_, Aug 24 2002"
