        "For all 12 known Giuga numbers N, either both N-1 and N+1 are prime or neither is prime. Is it true that if any Giuga number N is adjacent to a prime N-1 or N+1, then in fact N lies between twin primes N-1, N+1?",

So a(7) is not equal to g-1. But g+1 is prime (certified using the APRCL test in Pari) so g provides a negative answer to the above question. - _Ralf Stephan_, Jan 20 2014 (corrected by _Jonathan Sondow_, Jan 21 2014)",
