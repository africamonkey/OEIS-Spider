        "The Chebyshev primes (of index 1) are such odd primes that satisfy li[psi(p)]-li[psi(p-1)]<1 (sequence A196667), where li(x) is the logarithmic integral and psi(x) is the Chebyshev's psi function.",
        "The present sequence lists the number of Chebyshev primes less than 10^n, (n=1,2,...).",
        "The sequence suggests the density pi(x)/2 for the Chebyshev primes, where pi(x) is the density of primes."
