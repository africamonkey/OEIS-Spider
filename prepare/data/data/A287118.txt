        "For the first twelve terms of this sequence, corresponding values of A284644(k) are 11*2^2, 11*2^3, 11*2^4, 11*2^5, 11*2^6, 11*31*2^2, 3*5*23*2^2, 11*31*2^3, 11*31*2^4, 11*31*2^5, 11*31*2^6, 11*31*2^7 and k - A284644(k) are 40, 84, 172, 348, 700, 1356, 1374, 2720, 5448, 10904, 21816, 43640.",
        "Additionally, a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + 4 for 1 < n < 6 and a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + 8 for 8 < n < 13. In fact, also 5448 = 2720*2 + 8 but there is a(7) = 2754 between 2720 and 5448. In other words, we can partition sequence up to 10^5 as three subsequences: {84, 172, 348, 700, 1404}, {2754}, {2720, 5448, 10904, 21816, 43640, 87288} in order to see curious recursive patterns.",
