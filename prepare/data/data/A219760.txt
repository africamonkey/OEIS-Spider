        "a(n) is the minimal number of counters that can be placed on an n X n chessboard, no three in a line, such that adding one more counter on any vacant square will produce three in a line.",

        "2 y[k] <= sum {(i,j) in SQUARES[k]} x[i,j] <= 2 for all lines k [no 3-in-a-line, and if y[k] = 1 then exactly two queens appear in line k]",

        "a(26)=26: there is a solution in which every queen appears in an odd-numbered row and an odd-numbered column, and furthermore cell (i,j) is occupied if and only if cell (j,i) is occupied. Such solutions exist when n=10, 18, 26. Conversely it's known that a(n)>=n when n is even.",
