    "name": "Number of monotone functions f: 2^X -> 2^X where 2^X is the power set of an n-set X. Here f is monotone means that if A is a subset of B then f(A) is a subset of f(B).",
    "comment": [
        "Proof of formula by Robert Israel: If f is monotone, then for each x in X the set G(x) = {A in 2^X: x in f(A)} is an upset, i.e. if A is in G(x) and A \\subset B then B is in G(x). Conversely, if for each x in X the set G(x) is an upset, then f is monotone. And the family {G(x): x in X} determines f, since f(A) = {x: A is in G(x)}. So the cardinality of the set of monotone set-functions is N(|X|)^|X| where N(|X|) is the cardinality of the set of upsets G of 2^X, or equivalently monotone Boolean functions. That is sequence A000372.",
