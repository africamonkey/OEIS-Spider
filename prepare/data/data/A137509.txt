        "12 = 2^2 * 3^1. So the multiset of exponents in the prime factorization of 12 is {1,2}. For a(12), we want the smallest integer > a(11)=53 of the form p^1 * q^2, where p and q are distinct primes. Checking: 54 = 2^1 *3^3, so 54 fails. 55 = 5^1*11^1. 56 = 2^3*7^1. 57 = 3^1*19^1. 58 = 2^1*29^1. 59=59^1. 60 = 2^2*3^1*5^1. 61 = 61^1. 62 = 2^1 *31^1. So 54 through 62 all fail. But 63 = 3^2 * 7^1, which has the same multiset of prime exponents, {1,2}, as 12 has. Therefore a(12) = 63."
