        "A permutation p avoids a pattern q if it has no subsequence that is order-isomorphic to q. For example, p avoids the pattern 132 if it has no subsequence abc with a < c < b.",
        "Barred pattern avoidance considers permutations that avoid a pattern except in a special case. Given a barred pattern q, we may form two patterns, q1 = the sequence of unbarred letters of q and q2 = the sequence of all letters of q.",
        "A permutation p avoids barred pattern q if every instance of q1 in p is embedded in a copy of q2 in p. In other words, p avoids q1, except in the special case that a copy of q1 is a subsequence of a copy of q2.",
        "For example, if q=5{bar 1}32{bar 4}, then q1=532 and q2 = 51324. p avoids q if every for decreasing subsequence acd of length 3 in p, one can find letters b and e so that the subsequence abcde of p has b < d < c < e < a. (End)",

        "a(n) is indeed the number of permutations in S_n avoiding the pattern tau = 2{bar 5}3{bar 1}4 of the Pudwell comment.",
        "Proof. It is known (Claesson and  Mansour link, Proposition 2, p.2) that a(n) is the number of permutations in S_n avoiding both of the dashed patterns 1-23 and 12-3, and we show that a permutation p avoids tau <=> p avoids both 1-23 and 12-3.",
        "(=>) For an increasing triple abc in a tau-avoider p, there must be a \"5\" between the a and b. So p certainly avoids 12-3, and similarly p avoids 1-23.",
        "(<=) For an increasing triple abc in a (12-3)-avoider, there must be an entry x between a and b. We will see that an x>c can be found and this x will serve as the required \"5\". If x < b, you can take x as a new \"a\" and the new abc are closer in position. Repeat until x > b. If x < c, you can take x as a new \"b\" that is closer to c in value. Repeat until x > c. Done. An analogous method produces the required \"1\". (End)"
