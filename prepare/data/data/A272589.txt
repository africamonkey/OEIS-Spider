        "It is known that for almost all positive integers n, the sum of divisors of Fibonacci(n) is not a Fibonacci number (see A272412). This sequence focuses on the sums of two Fibonacci numbers for a similar question. Since A000045 is obvious subsequence of A084176 by definition of Fibonacci numbers, the reason of existence of this sequence can be seen as a generalized version of question that is motivation of A272412."
