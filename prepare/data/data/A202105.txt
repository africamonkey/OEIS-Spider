        "This sequence was generated by adding 12 Fibonacci-like sequences [See: PROG]. Looking at the format 90n+43 modulo 9 and modulo 10 we see that all entries of A142334 have digital root 7 and last digit 3. (Reverting the process is an application of the Chinese remainder theorem.) The 12 Fibonacci-like sequences are generated (via the p and q values given in the PERL program) from the base p,q pairs 43*91, 19*7, 37*79, 73*61, 11*53, 29*17, 47*89, 83*71, 13*31, 49*67, 23*41, 59*77."
