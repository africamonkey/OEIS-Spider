        "150 in binary is 10010110. There is a run of one 1, followed by a run of two 0's, followed by a run of one 1, followed by a run of one 0, followed by a run of two 1's, followed finally by a run of one 0. So the runs of 0's are of lengths (2,1,1), and the runs of 1's are of the lengths (1,1,2). Since (2,1,1) is a permutation of (1,1,2), then 150 is in the sequence. [From _Leroy Quet_, Aug 01 2009]"
