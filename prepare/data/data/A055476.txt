        "The leading numbers free of the trailing end 0's in the entries of sequence a(n) are the corresponding powers of 2 written in base 5, i.e., A000866(n). - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Oct 26 2010",
        "The first formula follows from the fact that the quinary representation of 10^n - 1 is equal to the concatenation of the quinary representation of 2^n - 1 with four times the n-th repunit; so the successor 10^n is the concatenation of 2^n with n zeros. See the Regan link. - _Washington Bomfim_, Dec 24 2010"
