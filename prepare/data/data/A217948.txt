    "comment": [
        "With 2n cards, a riffle shuffle can be described as a permutation, where r becomes 2r-1 when r <= n and r becomes 2r-2n when r > n. The first and last cards are always left unaltered. Sequence A002326 describes the lengths of the longest orbits in the permutation. E.g. when 2n=10, the permutation can be described as (2,3,5,9,8,6)(4,7). The present sequence gives the values of 2n for which there is just one orbit on the 2n-2 cards, for example the permutation when 2n=12 is (2,3,5,9,6,11,10,8,4,7) containing all the 10 numbers other than 1 & 12.",
