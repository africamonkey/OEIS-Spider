        "Note that the first ten numbers in this sequence are all squares. Except for 121, these squares are the y^2 in the Pell equation x^2 - 2y^2 = 1, whose solutions (x,y) are in sequences A001541 and A001542. The equation x^a - 2y^b = 1 is very similar to Catalan's equation x^a - y^b = 1, which has only one solution. Bennett shows that the equation x^2 - 2y^b = 1 has no solutions for b>2. Hence all the terms in this sequence are squares and solutions other than the Pell solutions must satisfy x^a - 2y^2 = 1 for a>2. The one known solution is 3^5 - 2*11^2 = 1. Are there any others? - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 29 2006"
