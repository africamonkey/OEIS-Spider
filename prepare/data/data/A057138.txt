        "Original definition: \"Concatenate next digit at left hand end.\"",
        "This is misleading, since the concatenation of 0 yields the same term (leading zeros vanish), but upon the next concatenation of 1, the 0 reappears - except for a(1), which according to that description should equal a(1)=10: It is surprising that in this only case where the 0 is indeed present, it disappears upon left-concatenation of the digit 1! - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 13 2013",
        "From _Hieronymus Fischer_, Jan 23 2013: (Start)",
        "A definition which is also consistent is: Start with terms 0 and 1 and then concatenate the next digit at left hand end. If the next digit is a zero, keep this zero in mind so that the then following digit is a 1 preceding a 0.",
        "The sequence terms are the terms of A057137 in reversed digit order. Based on this understanding, the anomaly for the indices 0 and 1 where the terms are 0 and 1 instead of 0 and 10 (what one would expect) becomes self-explaining. Also, the special behavior when the zero digit is encountered becomes clear.",
