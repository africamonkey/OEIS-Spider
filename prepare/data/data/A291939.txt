    "comment": [
        "If hailstone chains are strictly drawn in numerical order at right angles with consistent direction, overlaps occur. The first set of numbers that do not overlap could be considered the 'first layer'. Once an overlap is needed, all numbers farther up the chain (inclusive) are on a higher layer. This is the sequence of the first numbers to appear on layer n."

    "formula": [
        "If h(x) even: h(x+1) = h(x)/2; if h(x) odd: h(x+1) = 3*h(x) + 1.",
        "It is conjectured that h(x) reaches 1 in all cases."

    "example": [
        "At n=1: the first number is trivially 1;",
        "At n=2: 12 branching on to 6 requires covering 13, thus it is on layer 2."
