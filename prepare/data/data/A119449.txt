        "On average, there are as many prime numbers for which the sum of decimal digits is even as prime numbers for which it is odd [A119450]. This hypothesis, first made in 1968, has recently been proved by researchers from the Institut de Mathematiques de Luminy. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, May 13 2010",
        "Also primes such that absolute value of difference between largest digit and the sum of all the other digits is an even integer. This is in accordance with hypothesis of Alexandre Gelfond, proved by C. Mauduit and J. Rivat, see the link below. - _Osama Abuajamieh_, Feb 10 2017."
