        "The three possible assumptions considered here are the following:",
        "s (for n odd) indicates that we are working in the \"supergroup\" and so take account of twists of the face centers.",
        "m (for n > 3) indicates that the pieces are marked so that we take account of the permutation of the identically-colored pieces on a face.",
        "i (for n > 3) indicates that we are working in the theoretical invisible group and solve the pieces on the interior of the cube as well as the exterior. It is assumed that the M and S traits apply to the interior pieces as if they were on the exterior of a smaller cube."
