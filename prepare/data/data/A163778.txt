        "Archimedes' spiral with polar equation r=c(pi + a) (c>0; a is the angle) defines a family of permutations: 1 is placed at the origin of the XY-plane and each time, as a increases, that r hits the X-axis we put the next number on the X-axis; reading the numbers from left to right yields the permutation of 1..N (N>=2) given by N-1 N-3 ... 5 3 1 2 4 6 ... N-1 N (if N is even) or N N-2 ... 5 3 1 2 4 6 ... N-3 N-1 (if N is odd). Then N is an A_1-prime if this permutation consists of a single cycle of length N. So all A_1-primes are odd.",
        "No formula is known for a(n): the A_1-primes have been found by exhaustive search. But we have: (1) N is an A_1-prime iff N is odd, p=2N+1 is a prime number and only one of +2 and -2 generates Z_p^* (the multiplicative group of Z_p); (2) N is an A_1-prime iff p=2N+1 is a prime number and exactly one of the following holds: (a) N == 1 (mod 4) and +2 generates Z_p^* but -2 does not, (b) N == 3 (mod 4) and -2 generates Z_p^* but +2 does not.",
        "The A_1-primes are the odd T- or Twist-primes (the T-primes are the same as the Queneau-numbers, A054639). For the related A_0-, A^+_1- and A^-_1-primes, see A163777, A163779 and A163780. Considered as a set, the present sequence is the union of the A^+_1-primes (A163779) and the A^-_1-primes (A163780). It is also equal to the difference of A054639 and the A_0-primes (A163777)."
