        "The sequence is infinite because all the numbers 1025*100^k are members.",
        "It would be nice to have the subsequence of \"primitive\" terms, those that do not end in an even number of zeros.",
        "Let v be a number such that v^2 starts with 1. Let w^2 have the same digits as v^2 except that the initial digit is a 2. Then (w + v) * (w - v) = w^2 - v^2 = 10^m for some integer m. For the  \"primitive\" terms, w + v turns out to be 250, 8000, 31250 etc. w - v turns out to be 40, 1250, 3200 etc. Given such w + v and w - v it is easy to find primitive elements. Furthermore, v must lie in (sqrt(11), sqrt(20)) * sqrt(10)^i and w must lie in (sqrt(21), sqrt(30)) * sqrt(10)^i for some integer i. - _David A. Corneth_, May 20 2016"
