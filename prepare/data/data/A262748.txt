    "comment": [
        "Present numbers are the only composite integers that may appear in the sequence A135506. Moreover, for every present number m there exists s such that if we replace x(1) with s in that sequence, then x(m) = m (see the link). The rest of the odd composite numbers are called absent numbers, which are sequence A262741."
