        "6*a(n-3) is the number of distinct nonbacktracking paths of length n on a unit cube which start on a given vertex and end on the same one (if n is even) or the opposite one (if n is odd). E.g., a(7)=69 because a(7)=a(6)+4*a(4)=33+4*9=69. a(3)=5 because there are 6*a(6-3)=6*5=30 nonbacktracking paths of length 6 on a unit cube that end on the same vertex (6 is even); if we name the vertices of a unit cube ABCDEFGH in the order of x+2y+4z, such paths starting from A are ABDCGEA, ABDHFBA, ABDHFEA, ABDHGCA, ABDHGDA; the remaining 25 can be derived from these 5 reflecting them about the ABGH plane and rotating the resulting 10 around the AH axis by 120 and -120 degrees. - _Michal Kaczmarczyk_, Apr 24 2006",
        "The compositions of n in which each natural number is colored by one of p different colors are called p-colored compositions of n.  For n>=3, 5*a(n-3) equals the number of 5-colored compositions of n with all parts >=3, such that no adjacent parts have the same color. - _Milan Janjic_, Nov 27 2011",
