        "This is very useful in showing the number of primes in the range [p_k, 2*p_(i-n)] is greater than or equal to 1. By taking into account the size of the gaps between primes in [p_(i-n),p_k], one can see that the average prime gap is about log(p_k) using the following R_n / (2*n) ~ log(R_n).",
