        "Blocks of 1's and 2s are variables: A = 1, B = 2, C = 11, D = 12, E = 21, ... Not (also written -) = 3; And = 4; Xor = 5; Or = 6; Implies = 7; Equiv = 8; Left Parenthesis = 9; Right Parenthesis = 0. Operator binding strength is in numerical order, Not > And > ... > Equiv. The non-associative \"Implies\" is evaluated from Left to Right; A->B->C = is interpreted (A->B)->C. Redundant parentheses are permitted, so long as they are balanced and centered on a valid variable or sentential formula and not on the null character.",
        "Besides A101273, there can also be the subsequence of theorems that can be proved within the more restricted Intuitionist logic; the sequence of well-formed formulas whose truth value is contingent on the truth values of their variables; and many others. As with A101273, I conjecture that a power law approximates the number of integers in this sequence, where the number with N digits is approximately N to the power of some real number D.",
        "Comment from Ed Brims (ejbrims(AT)hotmail.com), Aug 18 2008: Quite interestingly, this sequence is quoted (in its original incorrect form) in the novel \"The End of Mr Y\" by Scarlett Thomas, towards the end of Chapter 12."
