    "comment": [
        "The index of a prime p = 3 mod 4 as a Gaussian prime is well defined, it is summed up by 1 for the complex prime 1+i (as factor of prime 2 = -i*(1+i)^2).",
        "The count of primes (3 mod 4) <= p, which remain unchanged as they cannot be factored further into complex primes 2 times the count of primes (1 mod 4) <= p**2 (such primes p1 are split into two distinct complex primes of the first quadrant with size sqrt(p1)).",
        "As the result from the splitting of the primes 1 mod 4, the indices of primes 3 mod 4 as Gaussian prime grows rather rapidly against their index as normal prime.",
        "Interesting numerical effects: the prime index of 43 is 14, with 3*14+1 = 43. 43 is the upper part of twin prime with 41 (which would be 14*3 - 1 with an index 14, if 1 was counted as prime). 4241 and 4243 are both primes.",
        "The ratio f between both indices can be estimated as f = (p^2 / log(p^2)) / (p / log(p)) = p/2. - _Sven Simon_, May 26 2011"
