        "This sequence results from removing the terms of A071395 from A091191 (which are the two primitive abundant number sequences).",
        "Each term of this sequence will be even (unless there exists an odd perfect number), be a multiple of a perfect number (A000396), and have just one perfect proper divisor.",
        "If N is an even perfect number, then N = 2^(p-1)*M_p, where p is prime (A000043) and M_p = 2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime (A000668).  Abundant numbers of the form 2*N and q*N, where q is a prime number greater than or equal to M_p, will have no abundant proper divisors and only one perfect proper divisor (which is N)."
