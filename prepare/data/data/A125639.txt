        "Unlike abundant numbers, not all multiples of doubly abundant numbers are doubly abundant; for instance, 48 is not doubly abundant. There are infinitely many doubly abundant numbers; for instance, all numbers of the form 24*25^k are doubly abundant. Such a number is abundant, being a multiple of an abundant number and s(24*25^k) = s(24)*s(25^k) + 24*s(25^k) + 25^k*s(24), which is a multiple of s(24) = 36."
