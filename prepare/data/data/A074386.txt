        "If n belongs to this sequence, it may have at most two distinct prime divisors. If n=p^k, then sigma(p^k) = (p^(k+1)-1)/(p-1) = r^2 for some prime r. For k=1, it trivially has the only solution n=3; while for k>1 it is a partial case of the Nagell-Ljunggren equation and has the only prime solution r=11 (see Bennett-Levin 2015) corresponding to n=3^4=81. If n=p^k*q^m, then sigma(n) = (p^(k+1)-1)/(p-1) * (q^(m+1)-1)/(q-1) = r^2 for some prime r, implying that (p^(k+1)-1)/(p-1) = (q^(m+1)-1)/(q-1) = r. Here k+1 and m+1 must be odd distinct primes. The Goormaghtigh conjecture would imply that its only solution is n=400 with (p,k,q,m)=(5,2,2,4). - _Max Alekseyev_, Apr 24 2015"
