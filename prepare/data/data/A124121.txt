        "Double Wieferich prime pairs are pairs of primes (p, q) such that q^(p-1) == 1 (mod p^2) and p^(q-1) == 1 (mod q^2). This sequence gives the primes q which are the lesser member (listed second) of such pairs, in increasing order, but without multiplicity:",
        "For example, currently there are two known double Wieferich prime pairs (p, q) with q = 5: (1645333507, 5) and (188748146801, 5). In this sequence, 5 is only listed once, as a(3), and only the lesser value p=1645333507 is listed as A124122(3).",
        "This is just the list of known pairs: there may be gaps, i.e. missing primes."
