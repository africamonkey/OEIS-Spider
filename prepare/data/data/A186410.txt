    "comment": [
        "The sequence gives the total number of cells turned ON after n stages in a cellular automaton based on Z^3 lattice in the same way that A183060 is based on the Z^2 lattice. In general here each cell has six neighbors.",
        "It appears that after 2^k stages the structure resembles a pyramid. For the first differences see A186411."
