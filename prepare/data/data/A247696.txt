        "The 3-principalization type (transfer kernel type, TKT) E.9 (2334) is not a permutation and has two fixed points.",
        "The nilpotency condition cl(G)=2n+5 for the second 3-class group is equivalent to a transfer target type, TTT (called IPAD by Boston, Bush and Hajir) of the shape [(3,9),(3^{n+2},3^{n+3}),(3,9)^2].",
        "The second 3-class group G is one of two vertices of depth 1 on the coclass tree with root SmallGroup(243,8) contained in the coclass graph G(3,2).",
