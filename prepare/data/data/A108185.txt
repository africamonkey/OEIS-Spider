        "A matrix is Cantorian if no row matches any of the strings obtained by taking one term from each column in turn in such a way that they are from different rows. That is, no row word can match any transversal word.",
        "More precisely, let the matrix be M = (M_ij). Then no row (M_i1, M_i2, ..., M_in) can agree with any \"transversal\" (M_{1, pi(1}}, ..., M_{n, pi{n}}) for any permutation pi in S_n."
