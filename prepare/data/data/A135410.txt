        "An \"up-down signature\" of the permutation (p(1),p(2),p(3),...,p(n)) is the sequence of (n-1) signs (+ or -) where the k-th sign in the sequence is the sign of (p(k+1)-p(k)). All permutations of {1,2,3,...,n} which are their own inverses obviously have the same up-down signature as their inverse permutations.",
