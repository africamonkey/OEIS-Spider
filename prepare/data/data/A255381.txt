        "This sequence gives the first k+1 nonzero terms from A255371 (the k=1 case), A255372 (the k=2 case), etc., through A255380 (the k=10 case). Those sequences' definitions concern the number of strings of decimal digits that contain \"at least one\" string of exactly k consecutive \"0\" digits; the present sequence omits the words \"at least\" because, with k >= n, and thus 2k >= k+n, it is not possible to have more than one string of exactly k consecutive \"0\" digits in a string of k+n digits. (Two strings each having exactly k consecutive \"0\" digits would have to be separated by at least one nonzero digit, or else they would constitute a single string of exactly 2k consecutive \"0\" digits.)",
