Note: it can be seen that the Poulet numbers divisible by 73 bigger than 2701 (7957, 10585, 15841, 31609, etc.) can be written as 1314*n + 73 as well as 2628*m + 73.",

        "Note: This conjecture can't be extrapolated for Poulet numbers p1 with more than two prime factors; for instance, if p1 = 561 = 3*11*17, there indeed are bigger Poulet numbers divisible by 17 (such as 1105 and 4369) that can be written as 544*n + 17, but there also exist such numbers that can't be written this way, e.g., 2465. But the first conjecture can be extrapolated.",
