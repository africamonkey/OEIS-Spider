        "An occurrence of a ranpp (xy;z) in a matrix A=(a(i,j)) is a triple (a(i1,j1), a(i1,j2), a(i2,j1)) where i1<i2, j1<j2 and these elements are in the same relative order as those in the triple (x,y,z). In general, the number of m X n 0-1 matrices in question is given by (n+2)*2^(m-1)+2*m*(n-1)-2 for m>1 and n>1."
