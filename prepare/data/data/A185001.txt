        "This sequence follows on from A204540, which listed seven values of n for which basin(n) = 1. There are 37 known values of n for which basin(n) = 2. A search of numbers up to 10,000,000 has not uncovered any further integers satisfying this requirement. The possibility that there are even larger numbers with basins equal to 2 cannot be completely ruled out, but the chances of one being discovered are remote, in view of the fact that the average basin size for large values of n is approximately n/3, that is, over 2000000 in the region where the last known such integer was discovered.",
        "For unknown reasons, all integers > 5 with basins equal to 1 or 2 are even."
