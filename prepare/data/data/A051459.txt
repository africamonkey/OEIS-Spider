        "a(n) is the number of possible orderings of the vectors of the n-dimensional Boolean cube (hypercube) {0,1}^n in accordance with their (Hamming) weights. For arbitrary vectors u, v of {0, 1}^n, if wt(u)<wt(v) then u precedes v in such order. If wt(u)=wt(v) each of them can be before the other. The formula for a(n) is explained easily by the notion \"layer\" of the cube - the set of all vectors of equal weights, the k-th layer of the cube is formed by the vectors of weight k. Obviously, any vector from the i-th layer precedes any vector from the j-th layer, for 0 <= i < j <= n. Hence the vectors can be rearranged only into the same layer. The k-th layer of the cube consists of C(n,k) vectors of weight k, that can be rearranged in C(n,k)! ways, for k= 0..n. Finally, the formula is obtained by applying the multiplication rule.",
        "a(n) is also the number of maximum chains in {0,1}^n with respect to the relation weight order, defined by the (Hamming) weights of the vectors, as it is explained above.",
        "Both comments correspond to the name of sequence since the corresponding Boolean algebras are isomorphic. (End)"
