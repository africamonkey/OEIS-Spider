        "Suggested by a problem involving parking cars in Marx (2015). The Marx problem is slightly different, however, since a solution in her book shows one car that is adjacent to two of its eight neighbors.",
        "Can be formulated as an integer linear programming problem as follows. Define a graph with a node for each cell and an edge for each pair of cells that are a king's move apart. Let binary variable x[i] = 1 if a king appears at node i, and 0 otherwise. The objective is to maximize sum x[i]. Let N[i] be the set of neighbors of node i. To enforce the rule that x[i] = 1 implies sum {j in N[i]} x[j] <= 1, impose the linear constraint sum {j in N[i]} x[j] - 1 <= (|N[i]| - 1) * (1 - x[i]) for each i. - _Rob Pratt_, Jul 16 2015",
        "An alternative formulation uses constraints x[i] + x[j] + x[k] <= 2 for each forbidden triple of nodes."
