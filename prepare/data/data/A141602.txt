        "2^n/log(2^n) is an approximation to the number of primes < 2^n. A closely related function is x/(x^(1/x) - 1) when x is a power of 2. In general, for any x the limit of x/log(x) - x/(x^(1/x)-1) -> 1/2 as x -> infinity. The interesting thing about this relationship for powers of 2 is that we can easily approximate the number of primes < x = 2^n simply by repeated square roots to evaluate x^(1/x) in x/(x^(1/x)-1). You can do this on most calculators but only for small x because of rounding. So we have it, x/log(x) ~ x/(x^(1/x)-1) + 1/2 ~ Pi(x). For x = 2^n, we need not take logs rather just square roots to compute values for the PNT. It remains to prove this experimental result analytically."
