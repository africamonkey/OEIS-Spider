    "comment": [
        "In Euclidean geometry, a cyclic quadrilateral is a quadrilateral whose vertices all lie on a single circle. This circle is called the circumcircle or circumscribed circle, and the vertices are said to be concyclic.",
        "The area A of a cyclic quadrilateral with sides a, b, c, d is given by Brahmagupta's formula: A = sqrt((s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)) where s, the semiperimeter is s = (a+b+c+d)/2.",
        "The circumradius R (the radius of the circumcircle) is given by:",
        "R = sqrt[(ab+cd)(ac+bd)(ad+bc)]/4A.",
        "The corresponding R of a(n) are not unique; for example, for a(12) = 1680 => (a,b,c,d) = (24, 24, 70, 70) with R = 37 and (a,b,c,d) = (40, 40, 42,42) with R = 29.",
        "The smallest corresponding R of a(n) is {5, 10, 13, 15, 17, 25, 20, 25, 26, 25, 41, 29, ...}.",
        "Properties of this sequence:",
        "A majority of quadrilaterals [a, b, c, d] have the property that a = b and c = d, and in this case s = a+c, A = a*c and R = sqrt(a^2+c^2)/2. Because a and c are even => a = 2p and c = 2q, then A = 4pq and R = sqrt(p^2+q^2). Consequently, 2*A103251(n) is included in this sequence.",
        "Nevertheless, there also exist quadrilaterals whose four sides are distinct, for example [a, b, c, d] = [14, 30, 40, 48] => A = 936 = a(8) and R = 25. The subset of a(n) with this property is {936, 2856, 3744, 3864, 4536, 5016, 5376, 5712, 5880, 6696, 7056, 7560, ...}."
