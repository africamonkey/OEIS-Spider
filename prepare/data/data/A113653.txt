    "comment": [
        "Isolated semiprimes in the hexagonal spiral, embedded in the triangular lattice, are the analogy to A113688 \"Isolated semiprimes in the [square] spiral,\" as well as analogous in another way to the hexagonal prime spiral of [Abbott 2005; Weisstein, \"Prime Spiral\", MathWorld]. A113519 Semiprimes in first spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056105). A113524 Semiprimes in second spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056106). A113525 Semiprimes in third spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056107). A113527 Semiprimes in fourth spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056108). A113528 Semiprimes in fifth spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A056109). A113530 Semiprimes in sixth spoke of a hexagonal spiral (A003215). This is embedded in the hexagonal spiral of A003215 and A001399, which is centered on zero; of course such a spiral can be constructed beginning with any integer. Centering on zero gives the interesting partition and multigraph equalities of A001399."
