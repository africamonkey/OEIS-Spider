        "Express n = sum k_i^2 so as to minimize sum k_i. There may be more than one such sum; for example 12 = 3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2. If every such minimal sum uses squares only of numbers < floor(sqrt(n)), n is included in this sequence.",

        "(1) Reformulate the definition of A138554 as follows: (*) A138554(n) = min (k + A138554(n-k^2)), where k goes over 1,2,...,[sqrt(n)].",
        "(2) Prove by induction on n that [sqrt(n)] <= A138554(n) < [sqrt(n)] + 2*n^(1/4) + 1.6",
        "(3) These inequalities imply that if k_1^2 + ... + k_s^2 = n and A138554(n) = k_1 + ... + k_s, where k_1 <= ... <= k_s, then k_s = [sqrt(n)] or [sqrt(n)] - 1.",
        "(4) By direct comparison of computations of (*) for k = [sqrt(n)] and k = [sqrt(n)] - 1, using the bounds (2), derive that the latter value can be smaller than the former one only for finitely many n. This proves the finiteness."
