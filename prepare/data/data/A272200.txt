The present sequence gives such primes corresponding to A(m+1) == 1 (mod 3). The ones corresponding to A(m+1) not == 1 (mod 3) (the complement) are given in A272201.",
        "This bisection of the primes from A002476 is needed in the formula for the coefficients of the q-expansion (q = exp(2*Pi*i*z), Im(z) > 0) of the modular cusp form (eta(6*z))^4|_{z=z(q)} = Eta64(q) with Dedekind's eta function. See A000727 which gives the coefficients of the q-expansion of F(q) = Eta64(q^{1/6})/q^{1/6} = (Prod_{m>=0} (1 - q^m))^4. The coefficients  F(q) = Sum_{n >= 0} f(6*n+1)*q^n are given in the Finch link on p.5, using multiplicativity. For primes congruent to 1 modulo 6 the formula involves x_p and y_p which are the present A and B for prime p == 1 (mod 3).",
