        "This an exceptionally nice finite sequence based on a surprisingly simple but nontrivial rule: collapse the number expressed in base 3 by inserting plus signs and adding, while minimizing the number of steps (applications).",
        "Butler et al. (2014) proved that any number written in base 2 can be collapsed to a single digit in at most two steps. Any number written in base 3 can be collapsed to a single digit in at most two steps except, surprisingly, for the 11 numbers listed in this sequence. One thing that separates base 3 from larger bases is that there are only 11 base-3 numbers that require three applications!",
