        "A connected graph is called k-decomposable if it is possible to remove some edges and leave a graph with at least two connected components in which every component has at least k nodes.",

        "A necessary and sufficient condition seems to be that there are no two node-disjoint subtrees each of which is P_4 or K_{1,3}.",
        "Alternatively, a tree with n vertices is k-decomposable iff, for each edge, removing that edge leaves a component with at most k-1 vertices. Finding the maximal k such that a tree is k-decomposable is easy to do in linear time. (End)",
