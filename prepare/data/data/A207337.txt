        "For n>=2 the smallest positive representative of the class of nontrivial solutions of the congruence x^2==1 (Modd a(n)) is x=m(n). The trivial solution is the class with representative x=1, which also includes -1. For the prime a(1)=5 the smallest positive nontrivial solution is 3 (see A027862(1) with  A002731(1)). Such a nontrivial smallest positive representative exists for each unique class of solutions of this congruence Modd p for any prime p of the form 4*k+1, given in A002144. Here the subset with k=k(n)=(a(n)-1)/4 appears, namely 1, 4, 7, 13, 18, 27, 34, 70,... For Modd n see a comment on A203571."
