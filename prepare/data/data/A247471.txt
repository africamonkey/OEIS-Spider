        "B(n) is the set of lattice paths of weight n that start in (0,0), end on the horizontal axis and never go below this axis, whose steps are of the following four kinds: h = (1,0) of weight 1, H = (1,0) of weight 2,  u =  (1,1) of weight 2, and d =  (1,-1)  of weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps."
