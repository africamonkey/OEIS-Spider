        "If r is even, then the least term of continued fraction of (rm/2)^2+m is r for all m >= 1. On the other hand, the least term of continued fraction of r^4/4 + r^3 + 2r^2 + 3r+2 is also r but it is not of the form (rm/2)^2+m.",
        "If r is odd, then the least term of continued fraction of (rm)^2+2m is r for all m >= 1 and the least term of continued fraction of r^4 + r^3 + 5*(r+1)^2/4 is also r but it is not of the form (rm)^2+2m.",
        "This means that 1936*m^2 + m are terms of the sequence for all m >= 1 and 15689610 is also a term but not of the form 1936*m^2 + m.",
