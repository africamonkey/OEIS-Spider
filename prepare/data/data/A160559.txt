        "A collection of congruences with distinct moduli, each greater than 1, such that each integer satisfies at least one of the congruences, is said to be a covering system. Let N be the gcd of these moduli. We consider minimal N's, i.e. N is a gcd of some moduli, but none of the divisors has this property."
