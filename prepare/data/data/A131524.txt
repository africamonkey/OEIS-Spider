        "To be an acceptable row, there must be at least one run of white squares and all runs of white squares must be of length at least three. Palindromic rows are of interest since if n is odd, the middle row of an n x n crossword puzzle must be palindromic if the puzzle is to have to usual rotational symmetry. Rather than use the explicit formula above, it is perhaps easier to observe that for all m, a(2m) = a(2m-1) and thus both the subsequences of odd-numbered terms and even-numbered terms are Fibonacci numbers - 1.
