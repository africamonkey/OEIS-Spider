        "If m and n are in the sequence, so is m+n-1, since n-dissecting one cube in an m-dissection gives an (m+n-1)-dissection. 1, 8, 20, 38, 49, 51, 54 are in the sequence because of dissections corresponding to the equations 1^3=1^3, 2^3=8*1^3, 3^3=2^3+19*1^3, 4^3=3^3+37*1^3, 6^3=4*3^3+9*2^3+36*1^3, 6^3=5*3^3+5*2^3+41*1^3 and 8^3=6*4^3+2*3^3+4*2^3+42*1^3.",
