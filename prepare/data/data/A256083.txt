        "Here a number is called balanced if the sum of digits weighted by their arithmetic distance from the \"center\" is zero.",

        "All balanced numbers with less than 4 digits are palindromic, and since there is no digit 3 in base 3, there cannot be a term in this sequence with 4 base-3 digits, where weights are (-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2)."
