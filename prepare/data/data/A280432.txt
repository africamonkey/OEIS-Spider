        "This sequence arises in the following problem: Given a set of binary elements (e.g., coins that may have one of the two weights), determine whether all of them are the same by weighing equally sized non-overlapping subsets n times. a(n) is the maximum size of a set whose integrity can be checked with n weighings.",
