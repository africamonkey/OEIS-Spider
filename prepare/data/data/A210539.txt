        "Primes > 7 occur in A210538 at indices n corresponding to digits \"1\" in the concatenation of the terms. This sequence lists counter-examples for which the reciprocal is not true, i.e., position of digits \"1\" not corresponding to primes.",
        "Note the irregular distribution: there are no terms between 34 and 187, but then many terms up to 597. These are followed by only 7 terms preceding 1020, which starts a series of 6 terms up to 1140."
