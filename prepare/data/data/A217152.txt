        "A squared rectangle (which may be a square) is a rectangle dissected into a finite number, two or more, of squares. If no two of these squares have the same size the squared rectangle is perfect. The order of a squared rectangle is the number of constituent squares.",
        "A squared rectangle is simple if it does not contain a smaller squared rectangle, compound if it does, and trivially compound if a constituent square has the same side length as a side of the squared rectangle under consideration."
