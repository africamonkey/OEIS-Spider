        "For n=3 we have pdw(3,3;2)_1=6, because ({1,2,5,6},{3,4}) is a palindromic partitioning of {1,...,6} into two parts such that no part contains an arithmetic progression of size 3, while {1,...,7} has no such *palindromic* partitioning (though it has a nonpalindromic partitioning by w(3,3;2)=9), since one of the parts needs to contain the midpoint 4 and thus cannot contain any other number (by palindromicity we would get an arithmetic progression of size 3)."
