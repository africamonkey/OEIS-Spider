        "Since 9 is not a prime, no element > 1 of the sequence A001019(k)=9^k (having k+1 digits in base 9, but 2k+1 divisors) can be member of this sequence. Also, no power of a prime less than 9 can be in the sequence, since it will always have fewer divisors than digits in base 9. However all powers of 11 up to 11^10 are in this sequence, having the same number of digits (in base 9) than the same power of 9 (since 10 = floor(log(11/9)/log(9))) and also that number of divisors (since 11 is prime)."
