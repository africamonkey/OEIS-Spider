        "Next term is greater than 8*10^8. If s=sum of the factorials of digits of n & reversal(n)>=s then 10^(reversal(n)-s)*n is in the sequence. Example n=23; s=2!+3!; reversal(23)-s=24 & 23*10^24 is in the sequence. So this sequence is infinite because there exists infinitely many numbers n such that reversal(n)>s. If n is a k-digit term of this sequence and the first digit of n is 1 then 10^(k-1)+n is also in the sequence. Examples : n=1 so 10^(1-1)+1=2 is in the sequence, n=17927300 so 10^7+17927300=27927300 is in the sequence. If n>5 then 10 divides a(n). If 10 doesn't divide a(n) then the reversal of n is in the sequence A010480, so all terms of A010480 are : reversal(1), reversal(2), reversal(541) & reversal(58504)."
