        "a(n) contains all even numbers that are not in A279040 or in A273457. I have verified numerically for all even numbers 4 < 2n < 4*10^10 that a Goldbach partition with the additional condition p > sqrt(2n) exists. It is conjectured that a(n) = 2*(n+12987) for all n > 7838315. If this conjecture is true, all even numbers 2n > 15702604 have all three types of Goldbach partitions and therefore fulfill the \"extended Goldbach conjecture\"."
