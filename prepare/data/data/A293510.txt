    "comment": [
        "A cover of a finite set S is a finite set of finite nonempty sets with union S. A cover is minimal if removing any edge results in a cover of strictly fewer vertices. A cover is connected if it is connected as a hypergraph or clutter. Note that minimality is with respect to covering rather than to connectedness (cf. A030019)."
