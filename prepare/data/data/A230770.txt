        "All semiprimes of the form 2^m-1 are in the sequence. Because if 2^m-1=p*q where p and q are prime then sigma(2^m-1)+phi(2^m-1)=(p+1)*(q+1)+(p-1)*(q-1)=2(p*q+1)=2^(m+1). 15, 511, 2047, 8388607 and 137438953471 are the first five such terms of the sequence.",
        "Also if p=(2^m-5)/9 is prime then n=4*p is in the sequence. Because phi(n)+sigma(n)=9*p+5=2^m. 12, 908, 58952 and 77433143050453552574776799557806810784652 are the first four such terms of the sequence.",
