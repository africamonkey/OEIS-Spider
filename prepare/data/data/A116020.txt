        "(II). If p=(10^n-7)/3 is prime then m=2p is in the sequence because sigma(m)-phi(m)=2p+4=6*(10^n-1)/9 is a repdigit number. 62 is the smallest such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006",
        "(III). If p=(4*10^n-31)/9 is prime then m=3p is in the sequence because sigma(m)-phi(m)=2p+6=8*(10^n-1)/9 is a repdigit number. 123 is the smallest such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006",
        "(IV). If p=(8*10^n-17)/9 is a prime then both numbers 4p & 46p are in the sequence because sigma(4p)-phi(4p)=5p+9=4*(10^(n+1)-1)/9 & sigma(46p)-phi(46p)=50p+94=4*(10^(n+2)-1)/9 are repdigit numbers. 28 & 322 are the smallest such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006",
