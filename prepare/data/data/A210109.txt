        "A binary sequence (or word) W of length n is 3-divided if it can be written as a concatenation W = XYZ such that XYZ is strictly earlier in lexicographic order than any of the five permutations  XZY, ZYX, YXZ, YZX, ZXY.",
        "More generally, fix an alphabet A = {0,1,2,...,a-1}.",
        "Define lexicographic order on words over A in the obvious way: for single letters, i < j is the natural order; for words U, V, we set U < V iff u_i < v_i at the first place where they differ; also U < UV if V is nonempty, etc.",
        "Then a word U over A is \"k-divided over A\" if it can be written as U = X_1 X_2 ... X_k in such a way that X is strictly less in lexicographic order than X_pi_1 X_pi_2 ... X_pi_k for all nontrivial permutations pi of [1..k].",
        "All 2^n binary words are 1-divided. For 2-divided words see A209970.",
        "\"k-divisible\" would sound better to me than \"k-divided\", but I have followed Lothaire and Pirillo-Varricchio in using the latter term. Neither reference gives this sequence."
