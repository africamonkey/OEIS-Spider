        "The path cannot intersect itself, not even on single points. \"Increasing\" means that the (Euclidean) length of each segment must be strictly greater than that of the previous one.",
        "The analogous sequence for a triangular (isogonal) grid seems to satisfy a(n) = 2n+1, with 2^(n-2) such paths up to isomorphism."
