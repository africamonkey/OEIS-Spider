        "For any three-term recurrence S(n) = S(n-1)*x1 + S(n-2)*x2*1, with S(-1) = 0 and S(0) = 1, with n-independent coefficients (like here x1=8 and x2=12) one can use the standard Morse code with a dot of length 1 standing for x1 and a dash of length 2 standing for x2. The Morse code polynomial S(x1,x2;n) is then obtained by summing over all codes of length n. E.g., S(x1,x2;3) = x1^3 + 2*x1*x2 from dot dot dot, dot dash and dash dot. Here x1=8 and x2=12 (labeled dots and dashes). For example, S(3) = 8*(8^2 + 2*12) = 704 = b(3) = a(4), because in a the offset differs from the one for S. See the Graham et al. book, on Morse code polynomials (Euler's continuants), p 302. This comment was motivated by an earlier one from the author of this sequence. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Mar 27 2014",
