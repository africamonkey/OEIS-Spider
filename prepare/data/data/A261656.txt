        "This sequence is interesting because the sequence of any member's divisors increases approximately exponentially, without members having any repeated prime factors.",

        "This sequence would be particularly interesting if the b and c of one member were the a and b of another, as it could give us a number with 4 prime factors and similar properties as here. The resulting compound would be a member of A261658. No such pairs exist in this sequence with any lowest factor < 10000."
