        "For n>=2 there cannot be more than 2^n - 1 consecutive n-almost primes. Is it known whether there always exists such a run of length 2^n - 1? If not, I conjecture so. This is confirmed to be true for terms through a(4). Terms here equal the last terms of corresponding finite sequences: a(3) = A067813(6). a(4) was computed by _Don Reble_ as A067814(14). a(5) >= A067820(12).",
        "a(4) is smaller than the number 488995430567765317569 found by Forbes. [From _T. D. Noe_, Oct 29 2008]"
