        "The first few terms are the same as A038128. However, A038128 is generated by Euler's constant = 0.5772156649015328606065120901..., which is close but not equal to 1/sqrt(3) = 0.5773502691896257645091487805..., which generates this sequence. Euler/(1/sqrt(3)) = 0.9997668585341064519813571911... and the equality fails in the 97th term."
