        "With a prime triple (p,p+4,p+6), the number a(n) = 2*p*(p+6) is always in the sequence, f( f( 2*p*(p+6) )) = f( 2*(p+4) ) = p+6. Such prime triples can be found in sequence A022005.",
        "As long as two successive triples (p1,p1 + 4,p1 + 6) and (p2,p2 + 4,p2 + 6) of A022005 have p2 < 1.2*p1, no other numbers occur in the sequence between a(n1) and a(n2), this holds at least for larger p1 > 500. Other types of prime sets occurring in the sequence: (p,p+4,3p-4) with F( F( (p+4)*(3p-4))) = F( 4p ) = p + 4 (p,p+6,p+8) with F( F( 4*p*(p+8) )) = F( 2*(p+6) ) = p + 8.",
