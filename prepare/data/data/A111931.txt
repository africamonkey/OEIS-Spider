    "comment": [
        "A000236(n) is the maximum length of a run of consecutive residues modulo prime p, starting with 1, where no two adjacent elements belong to the same n-th power residue class (in other words, there is no n-th power residue modulo p in the sequence of ratios 1/2, 2/3, ..., (A000236(n)-1)/A000236(n)). a(n) equals the smallest p admitting a run of maximum length A000236(n)."
