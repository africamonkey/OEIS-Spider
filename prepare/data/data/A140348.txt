    "comment": [
        "The process of expressing a word in generators as a sorted word in generators and commutators is Marshall Hall's 'collection process'.",
        "Since this monoid 'lives in' a nilpotent group, it inherits the growth restriction of a nilpotent group. So according to a result of Bass, a(n) = O( n^8).",
        "It seems this is the correct growth rate. This sequence may well have a rational generating function, though, according to a result of M Stoll, the growth function of a nilpotent group need not be rational, or even algebraic.",
        "Computations on a free nilpotent group, or on submonoids, may be aided by using matricies. I. D. MacDonald describes how to do this in an American Mathematical Monthly article and he gives a recipe explicitly for the nil-2, 3 generator case."
