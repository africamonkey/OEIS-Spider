        "The only integer solutions (a,b) to the equation a^b = b^a are (k,k) for k >= 1, (2,4), and (4,2).",

        "Now f(x) = log(x)/x is strictly increasing at (0,e) and strictly decreasing at (e, +infinity), so if 0<x<y<e or e<y<x then f(x)<f(y).",
        "To have f(a) = f(b) (which means a^b = b^a), a must be in (0,e) and b in (e, +infinity). Let g(a) be the restriction of f to (0,e) and h(b) to (e, +infinity). Since g and h are monotonic, there is a natural bijection between a and b such that g(a) = h(b).",
