        "Definition: For positive integers b (as base) and n, the positive integer (allowing initial zeros) a(n) is expomorphic relative to base b (here 4) if a(n) has exactly n decimal digits and if b^a(n) == a(n) (mod 10^n) or, equivalently, b^a(n) ends in a(n). [See Crux Mathematicorum link.]",
        "For sequences in the OEIS, no term is allowed to begin with a digit 0 (except for the 1-digit number 0 itself). However, in the problem as defined in the Crux Mathematicorum article, leading 0 digits are allowed; under that definition, \"0411728896\" would be included because the last 10 digits of 4^0411728896 are 0411728896, and also 02555290411728896\" because the last 17 digits of 4^02555290411728896 are \"02555290411728896\". However, these are not in the sequence as defined here. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_"
