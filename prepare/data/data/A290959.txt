        "Let f(q, r) be the number of dots in the intersection of the Ferrers diagrams of the integer partitions q and r of n. Let a(n) be the matrix rank of the p(n) by p(n) matrix of f(q, r) as q and r range over the partitions of n. Conjecture: For n > 3, a(n+1) - a(n) = A000005(n+2), the number of divisors of n. The same is true empirically for the union, complement, and set difference. Note that A000005 count rectangular partitions."
