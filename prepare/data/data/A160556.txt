    "comment": [
        "For these equations (not exclusively), the sequences of 2n + 1 are dominated by primes.",
        "When b = 2, there are 105 solutions with n less than 10000, and in this case, the sequence of n is also dominated by primes: only five of these are composite. The average difference between successive composite terms is near the magnitude of n. No composite values of 2n + 1 have been found. n and 2n + 1 account for roughly 3% of primes less than 20 billion. For other bases, n is almost always composite, and 2n + 1 is almost always prime.",
        "The next most productive values of b less than 1000 are 509 (41 solutions) and 824 (40 solutions).",
        "Bases that produce a greater or equal number of solutions than smaller bases, except 2, often have ones digit 4 or 9. Values of n associated with composite 2n + 1 are often divisible by 5."
