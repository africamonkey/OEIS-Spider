        "The number 666304038394 is the 48th element of A283157. That is, no even number below it has more preimages under the sum-of-proper-divisors function.",
        "There are exactly 130 elements in the sequence.",
        "In 2016, C. Pomerance proved that, for every e>0, the number of preimages is O_e(n^{2/3+e}).",
        "Conjecture: there exists a positive real number k such that the number of preimages of an even number n is O((log n)^k)."
