        "Conjecture. Let A be a very(5,1) (respectively very(5,4)) sequence of length n and let Z be a sequence of n-1 0's.. Then AZ(3A)ZA is a very(5,1) (respectively very(5,4)) sequence of length 5n-2. (Here 3A denotes the result of multiplying each term of A by 3, then reducing modulo 5; and juxtaposition of symbols denotes concatenation of sequences.)"
