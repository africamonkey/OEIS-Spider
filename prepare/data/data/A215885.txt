        "The Berndt-type sequence number 5a for the argument 2Pi/9 defined by the first relation from the section \"Formula\". We see that a(n) is equal to the sum of the n-th negative powers of the c(j) := 2*cos(2*Pi*j/9), j=1,2,4 (the A215664(n) is equal to the respective n-th positive powers, further both sequences can be obtained from the two-sided recurrence relation: X(n+3) = 3*X(n+1) - X(n), n in Z, with X(-1) = X(0) = 3, and X(1) = 0).",
