The entries of the sequence are those odd d for which g_d(x,y) and cx^jy^kg_m(x,y) have at least two terms in common (same coefficients) for some c > 0 and integers j,k and such that g_d(x,y) + cx^jy^k(1+y^m - g_m(x,y)) has all positive coefficients.",
    "comment": [
        "Note that g_k(x,y) always has positive coefficients. The sequence are degrees for which a certain construction (see paper by D'Angelo-Lebl) of proper monomial holomorphic mappings of balls does not give new noninvariant monomial mappings.",
        "It is unknown if this sequence is infinite (conjectured to be so). Furthermore A143106 is definitely a subsequence of this sequence, but it is unknown if the two are in fact equal."
