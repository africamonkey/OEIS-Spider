        "The smallest number with six distinct prime divisors is the product of first six primes, 2*3*5*7*11 = 30030. The smallest number with seven distinct prime divisors is product of first seven primes, 2*3*5*7*11*13 = 390390. Note that in A001358 (product of two primes), A014612 (product of three primes), A014613 (product of four primes), A014614 (product of five primes), primes are not necessarily distinct, so k-almost primes are the more general class than our d-almost primes with d=k. In the sequence, d-almost primes with d=6 are considered, see also A051270 (d=5), A033993 (d=4), A033992 (d=3), A007774 (d=2). The case d=1 (or k=1) corresponds to primes A000040."
