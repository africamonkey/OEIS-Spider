        "Same as twin primes p, p+2 such that (p+1)*(p+2) is a primary pseudoperfect number (A054377). Appears also to be same as twin primes p, p+2 such that p*(p+1) is a Giuga number (A007850). See the link \"The p-adic order of power sums...\": Theorem 8, Example 1, and Question 1.",
        "Is it always true that if a primary pseudoperfect number N > 2 is adjacent to a prime N-1 or N+1, then in fact N lies between twin primes N-1, N+1? For all 7 known primary pseudoperfect numbers N > 2, either both N-1 and N+1 are prime or neither is prime.",
