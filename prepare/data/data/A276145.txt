        "The so-called double circles are conjectured to minimize the number of triangulations, and in this case the next terms would be 203748, 674949, 2031054, 6807382, 20662980,...",
        "In a double circle, half of the points are extremal, and for every edge of the convex hull, there is one interior point that is arbitrarily close to it."
