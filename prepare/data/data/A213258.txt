        "Conjecture. The terms of this sequence are given by the positions of 2 in the fixed-point of the morphism 0->01, 1->02, 2->03, 3->01 (see A191255).   (This has been confirmed for over 5000 terms of A213257.)  To illustrate, the fixed-point of the indicated morphism is {0,1,0,2,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,...} and 2 occurs at positions {4,12,20,...}, integers in this sequence but missing from A213257.",
        "It appears that the terms of this sequence are all of the form of 4 times an odd integer multiplied by a nonnegative power of 8."
