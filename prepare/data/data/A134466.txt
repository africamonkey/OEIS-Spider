        "Note that a(n) = a(n-1) for n = [1,] 3, 6, 11, 20,... = A006127(2^k + k) (conjectured); this corresponds to the case where the string c (see A134457) satisfies c(n)=\"0\".c(n-1) (pre-pended \"0\"). The next string c(n+1) is obtained by inserting \"0\" after the first \"1\" and adding 1 (except for c(4) where both of these operations are equivalent and only one must be performed). - M. F. Hasler, Dec 17 2007"
