        "From _Altug Alkan_ and _Waldemar Puszkarz_, Apr 10 2016: All terms are congruent to 1 mod 6. Proof: For n > 2, prime(n) is 1 or 5 mod 6. If p is 5 mod 6, then it is of the form 3*k-1. For numbers of this form, the sum of digits is also of this form, as can be seen through the kind of reasoning used in proving that numbers divisible by 3 have the sum of digits divisible by 3. However, 3*k-1 can never be a square, meaning n^2+1 is never divisible by 3: any n is equal to one of 0, 1, 2 mod 3, thus by the rules of modular arithmetic, n^2+1 is 1 or 2 mod 3, never 0. Hence p must be congruent to 1 mod 6."
