The Dutch windmill graph D(m,n) (also called friendship graph) is the graph obtained by taking n copies of the cycle graph C_m with a vertex in common (i.e., a bouquet of n C_m graphs). The Wiener index of a connected graph is the sum of distances between all unordered pairs of vertices in the graph.",
