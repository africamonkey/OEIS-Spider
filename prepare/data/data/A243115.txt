        "a(n) is the lowest positive starting value of the reduced Collatz function such that all starting values (>1) that are congruent to a(n) (mod 2^d) have the same dropping time (d). The dropping time here counts the (3x+1)/2 and the x/2 steps as listed in A126241. A number is included in this sequence if 2^A126241(a(n)) > a(n).",
        "Starting values that produce new record dropping times as listed in A060412 are necessarily a subset of this sequence.",
        "If at least one iteration is carried out before checking that the absolute iterated value has become less than or equal to the absolute starting value, then a(n) is the lowest positive starting value such that all starting values (positive, zero or negative) that are congruent to a(n) (mod 2^d) have the same dropping time (d). Defined like this, the sequence would start with 0, 1, 3, 7, 11, 15, ... for a lead index value of 0."
