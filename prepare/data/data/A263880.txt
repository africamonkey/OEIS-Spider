        "There are six primes 2p + 1 such that p is a Fibonacci prime, namely, a(1) through a(6). By contrast, in the same range there are only two primes 2p - 1 such that p is a Fibonacci prime, namely, 2p - 1 = 3 and 5, for p = 2 and 3. Is there some modular restriction to explain this bias in favor of 2p + 1 over 2p - 1 among Fibonacci primes p?"
