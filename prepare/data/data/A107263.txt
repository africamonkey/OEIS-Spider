        "I extended the analysis of A032531(n) to all n<= 10^7. Same comments apply considering the new limit and, of course, the uniqueness of Stephan's sequence remains as always only a conjecture since there's no proof that the sequence should be anything different from the zero sequence for all, most or even any of the terms - Herman Jamke (hermanjamke(AT)fastmail.fm), Nov 08 2006"
