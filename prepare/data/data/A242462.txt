        "Note: this sequence will terminate if a power of 2 occurs.",
        "Conjecture: this sequence is infinite (so it contains no powers of 2). The similar sequence starting with a(1) = 6 terminates after 2 terms: 6 and 16.",
        "Conjecture is true if it turns out that one number in this sequence is one more than a multiple of 41. Any number of the form 2^n-1 that is divisible by 41 is also divisible by 25, which is the square of a prime number greater than 3. Because numbers one less than this sequence's terms are always 9 times a squarefree number, this proves that if a number one less than this sequence is divisible by 41, then this sequence is infinite. - _J.
