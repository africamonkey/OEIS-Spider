        "The subsequence of prime partial sums of emirps begins: 13, xxx, 787, 1489, 2137, 2843, 3232, 6857, 8369, 11923, 15797, 21943, 24103. The subsubsequence of emirp partial sums of emirps begins: 13, 32911 = emirp(736). Note that 787 is a prime when reversed, but not a different prime. The first square in the sequence is 169 and R(169) = 961 is also a square."
