        "Since 2^(2^n)+1 is prime for n=0,1,...,4 (Fermat primes), 2^(2^(n-1)+1)-2 is in the sequence for n=1,2,...,6. Conjecture: There are no further terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Sep 14 2004",
        "For k of the form 2^m and in the interval [a(n)/a(n-1) - 2, a(n+1)/a(n) - 2], with a(0) = 1, the numbers x such that u^k + (u+1)^k + ... + (u+x-1)^k is prime for some u are the divisors of a(n) (excluding 1 as a divisor for n > 1).",
        " Example: n = 4. The interval [a(4)/a(3) - 2, a(5)/a(4) - 2] = [15, 255]. The numbers of the form 2^m for some m in this interval are 16 = 2^4, 32 = 2^5, 64 = 2^6, and 128 = 2^7. Taking k = 16 (for example), numbers x such that u^16 + (u+1)^16 + ... + (u+x-1)^16 is prime for some u are {2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 17, 30, 34, 51, 85, 102, 170, 255, 510} which are the divisors of a(4).
