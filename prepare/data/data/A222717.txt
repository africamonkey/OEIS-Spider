If p is not in A222717, then the smallest positive quadratic nonresidue of p is a primitive root g. Since the smallest positive quadratic nonresidue is always a prime, g is prime. But since all primitive roots are quadratic nonresidues, g is the smallest positive primitive root of p. Hence p is not in A047936.)",
