    "comment": [
        "This is an infinite sequence, since the solutions to the Pell equations for primes p=4n+1 will give ratios with limit 0. For example, the entry 7 satisfies 7^2 - 2*5^2 = -1 and the ratio is 5/7. However, not all entrys are given by this technique."

        "For n=3, a(3)=7 because 7^2+1=2*5*5 and 5/7 is smaller than all previous results."
