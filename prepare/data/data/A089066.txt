        "Let us consider two permutations to be equivalent if they can be obtained from each other by reversal (12345->54321), cyclic rotation (12345->(23451,34512,45123,51234), n+1-complement (31254->35412), or a combination of those three transformations (they commute with each other). a(n) is the number of classes. It is strictly inferior to (n-1)! for n>1.",
        "If rotation is replaced by addition of a constant modulo n, one obtains the same number of classes but not exactly the same permutations starting n=5.",
        "(End)",
        "Original explanation by R. Jerome : Generate all permutations of a string of length n, such as 1234, which has length 4; there are n!=24 of these. Now remove all that have cycles less than 4 characters long; if you only use cyclic notation and not array notation then of the n! possibly only (n-1)! need to be considered. Then calculate the Inverse, Vertical reflection, [VErt reflection inverse], Rotation by 180 degree and [ROt by 180 deg inverse]. If any of these already exist on the list then this permutation is not distinct. Items in []'s are unnecessary since VE(x)=V(I(x))=I(V(x))=R(x) and RO(x)=R(I(x))=I(R(x))=V(x). There are some that are rotationally symmetric and some that are vertically symmetric (only possible for even lengths), but the majority are nonsymmetric."
