        "Conjecture: For x > 1 there is at least 1 prime between prime(prime(x)) and prime(prime(x+1)).",
        "This conjecture is equivalent to saying that there is at least one prime index between prime(x) and prime(x+1), which is trivially true because both are odd for x > 1; one has prime(prime(x)) < prime(prime(x)+1) < prime(prime(x+1)). Obviously the definition is equivalent to \"primes > 2 with nonprime index\", i.e., sequence A007821 without the initial 2. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 31 2015"
