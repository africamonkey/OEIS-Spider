    "comment": [
        "Every semiprime must be in one of these three disjoint sets: the product of two primes of the form x^2+y^2, the product of two primes of the form x^2+3y^2, or the product of a prime of the form x^2+y^2 and a prime of the form x^2+3y^2. Equivalently, every semiprime must be in one of these three disjoint sets: the product of two primes of the form x^2+y^2 (2 or 4n+1), or the product of two primes of the form 4n+3, or the product of a prime of the form x^2+y^2 and a prime of the form 4n+3. In the latter case, such a semiprime is itself either of the form 4n+3 or the form 8n+6."
