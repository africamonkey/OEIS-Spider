        "For p prime, p^p satisfy the condition, hence A051674 (and also A048102) is a subsequence. Moreover, if p and q are primes and i and j are positive integers, if p^i * q^j verify the condition, then the same is true for p^j * q^i. So A122406 is also a subsequence. More generally, if a number is a term, then any permutation of the exponents in its prime factorization (i.e. any permutation of its prime signature) gives also a term. In addition, any number having no more than two distinct prime factors (apart their multiplicity) is a term iff it belongs also to A272858."
