        "The complexity of an integer n is the least number of 1's needed to represent it using only additions, multiplications, exponentiation and parentheses. This does not allow juxtaposition of 1's to form larger integers, so for example, 2 = 1+1 has complexity 2, but 11 does not (concatenating two 1's is not an allowed operation). The complexity of a number has been defined in several different ways by different authors. See the Index to the OEIS for other definitions. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Oct 20 2007"
