        "Suppose S = (s(0), s(1), s(2),...) is an infinite sequence such that every finite block of consecutive terms occurs infinitely many times in S.  (It is assumed that A006337 is such a sequence.)  Let B = B(m,k) = (s(m-k), s(m-k+1),...,s(m)) be such a block, where m >= 0 and k >= 0.  Let m(1) be the least i > m such that (s(i-k), s(i-k+1),...,s(i)) = B(m,k), and put B(m(1),k+1) = (s(m(1)-k-1), s(m(1)-k),...,s(m(1))).  Let m(2) be the least i > m(1) such that (s(i-k-1), s(i-k),...,s(i)) = B(m(1),k+1), and put B(m(2),k+2) = (s(m(2)-k-2), s(m(2)-k-1),...,s(m(2))).  Continuing in this manner gives a sequence of blocks B(m(n),k+n).  Let B'(n) = reverse(B(m(n),k+n)), so that for n >= 1, B'(n) comes from B'(n-1) by suffixing a single term; thus the limit of B'(n) is defined; we call it the \"limit-reverse of S with initial block B(m,k)\", denoted by S*(m,k), or simply S*.  (Since Beatty sequences are usually written with offset 1, the above definition is adapted accordingly, so that s(n) = A006337(n+1) for n >= 0.)",
