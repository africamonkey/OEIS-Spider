        "These are numbers n such that n and n+1 both have 10 divisors. Proof: clearly n and n+1 cannot both be of the form p^9, so for contradiction assume either n and n+1 is of the form p*q^4 and the other is of the form r^9 where p, q, and r are prime. So p*q^4 is either r^9 - 1 = (r-1)(r^2+r+1)(r^6+r^3+1) or r^9 + 1 = (r+1)(r^2-r+1)(r^6-r^3+1). But these factors are relatively prime and so cannot represent p*q^4 unless one or more factors are units. But this does not happen for r > 2, and the case r = 2 does not work since neither 511 not 513 is of the form p*q^4. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jun 19 2016"
