        "Given an m X n chocolate bar, let A(m,n) be the number of ways to break it into m*n unit pieces where each break occurs along a gridline. Order matters, and the pieces are distinguishable. Then this sequence lists the values A(m,n) in increasing order as m and n range over the positive integers.",
        "The sequence of factorials, A000142, is a subsequence as A(1,n) = A(n,1) = (n-1)!.",
        "For m,n>1, A(m,n) is divisible by 2^(m+n-2)."

        "For n = m = 2, there are two ways for the first break: breaking it horizontally or vertically. After that we need two more breaks that can be done in any order. Thus A(2,2) = 4, and 4 belongs to the sequence."
