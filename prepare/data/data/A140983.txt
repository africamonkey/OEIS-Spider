        "a(n) is the number of labeled incomplete ternary trees on n vertices in which each left or middle child has a larger label than its parent and each right child has a smaller label than its parent. For example, a(2)=3 because we have 2L1, 2M1 and 1R2. Here aLb means a is a left child of b, etc."
