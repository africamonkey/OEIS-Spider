        "Equivalent to the following variation on Fermat's Diophantine m-tuple: 1 + the product of any two distinct terms is not a square; this sequence, which we'll call sequence S, is produced by the following algorithm. At the start, S is initially empty. At stage n, starting at n = 1, the algorithm checks whether there exists a number m already in the sequence, such that mn+1 is a perfect square. If such a number m is found, then n is not added to the sequence; otherwise, n is added. Then n is incremented to n+1, and we repeat the procedure. Proof by Clark R. Lyons: We prove by strong induction that n is in the sequence S if and only if n == 1 (mod 4) or n == 2 (mod 4). Suppose now that this holds for all k < n. In case 1, either n == 1 (mod 4) or n == 2 (mod 4), and we wish to show that n does indeed enter the sequence S. That is, we wish to show that there does not exist m < n, already in the sequence at this point such that mn+1 is a square. By the inductive hypothesis m == 1 (mod 4) or m == 2 (mod 4). This means that both m and n are one of 1, 2, 5, or 6 mod 8. Using a multiplication table mod 8, we see that this implies mn+1 is congruent to one of 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7 mod 8. But we also see that mod 8, a perfect square is congruent to 0, 1, or 4. Thus mn+1 is not a perfect square, so n is added to the sequence. In case 2, n == 0 (mod 4) or n == 3 (mod 4), and we wish to show that n is not added to the sequence. That is, we wish to show that there exists m < n already in the sequence such that mn+1 is a perfect square. For this we let m = n-2, which is positive since n >= 3. By the inductive hypothesis, since m == 1 (mod 4) or m == 2 (mod 4) and m < n, m is already in the sequence. And we have mn + 1 = (n - 2)n + 1 = n^2 - 2n + 1 = (n - 1)^2, so mn+1 is indeed a perfect square, and so n is not added to the sequence. Thus n is added to the sequence if and only if n == 1 (mod 4) or n == 2 (mod 4). This completes the proof. - _Robert C. Lyons_, Jun 30 2016",
