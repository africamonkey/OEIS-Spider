    "comment": [
        "This sequence is of use in non-decimal systems whereby digits in base a(n) can be tested using simple addition tricks [and no higher operations] to determine if the number represented is relatively prime with respect to the first n primes.",
        "The addition trick for base a(n) is to sum digits to do a(n)-1 divisibility tests and alternately add and subtract digits to perform the a(n)+1 test. In base 10 we add digits to find 9-divisibility or add-subtract digits (e.g. 132 = 2-3+1 = 0 is divisible by 11) to find divisibility by 11.",
