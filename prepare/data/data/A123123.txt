        "From 7 on, sequence gives primes + two. This can be easily seen since the statement: 'numbers n such that there's only one k, 2<=k<=n, with n=2 (mod k)' is equivalent to the following: 'numbers n such that there's only one k, 2<=k<=n-2, that divides n-2'. So k|(n-2) and values of k: n and n-1 are not considered since don't divide n-2. But this 2nd statement is also the same as saying that n-2 is a prime number and so n = prime +2.",
