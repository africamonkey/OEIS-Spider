    "comment": [
        "A configuration is a set of triples (of points) where every pair of points occurs in at most one triple. (A Steiner triple system is a set of triples where every pair occurs exactly once; thus configurations are often called partial Steiner triple systems). The triples are also called blocks.",
        "A 'generator' is 'a configuration where every point occurs in at least two blocks'. The term refers to the work of Horak, Phillips, Wallis & Yucas, who show that the number of occurrences of a configuration in a Steiner triple system is expressible as a linear form in the numbers of occurrences of the generators.",
        "If you relax the restriction on the number of times a pair of points can occur in a configuration - so that a configuration is just any multi-set of triples - then we get A050913."
