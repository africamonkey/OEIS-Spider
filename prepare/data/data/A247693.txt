    "comment": [
        "The 3-principalization type (transfer kernel type, TKT) E.14 (3122) is not a permutation, contains a 3-cycle, and has no fixed points.",
        "The nilpotency condition cl(G)=2n+5 for the second 3-class group is equivalent to a transfer target type, TTT (called IPAD by Boston, Bush and Hajir) of the shape [(3^{n+2},3^{n+3}),(3,3,3),(3,9)^2].",
        "The second 3-class group G is one of two vertices of depth 1 on the coclass tree with root SmallGroup(243,6) contained in the coclass graph G(3,2).",
        "All these fields possess a Hilbert 3-class field tower of exact length 3.",
        "A247693 is an extremely sparse subsequence of A242878 and it is exceedingly hard to compute a(n) for n>0."
