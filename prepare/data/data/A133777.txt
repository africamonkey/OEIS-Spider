        "This sequence is interesting in view of Cayley's theorem which says that every finite group with n elements is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group S_n whose number of elements is n!. Therefore a(n) - 1 gives the number of groups \"competing\" with S_n in this respect. The eighth term, a(7), i.e. the number of isomorphism types of groups of order 7!=5040, seems to be unknown."
