        "The primes up to 2^(2^n) are exactly determined from the primes up to 2^(2^(n-1)), n >= 1, with the sieve of Eratosthenes. This gives an inductive algorithm to find all primes up to any integer (modulo space and time constraints...) This means that all odd primes are ultimately determined by the even prime, 2. - Daniel Forgues, Dec 04 2011"
