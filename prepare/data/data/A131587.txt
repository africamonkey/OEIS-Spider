        "Except for the first term, these numbers are divisible by 3. This follows from the fact that all primes are of the form 3m+1 or 3m+2 and the square of either of these forms is of the form 3h+1.",
        "Then for the first 10 primes, the sum of the squares becomes 4+9+3h*8+8 = 21+3h*8, which is divisible by 3.",
        "By induction, assuming that the sum of the squares of the first 10^n primes is divisible by 3, then the difference between the sum for n+1 and the sum for n is (3*h+1)*(10^(n+1) - 10^n) = (3*h+1)*(9*10^n), which is divisible by 3.
