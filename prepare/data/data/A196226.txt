(1) If m>=14 is a term of this sequence, then sigma(2,m) is congruent to 5 + m/2 modulo m;  (2) If m>=22 is a term of this sequence, then sigma(3,m) is congruent to 9 + m/2 modulo m;  If m>=38 is a term of this sequence, then sigma(4,m) is congruent to 17 + m/2 modulo m. (sigma(k,m) denotes the sum of the k-th powers of the divisors of m.)",
