        "a(n) is always divisible by n. A proof of this is currently (Oct 2010) being written up - we will add a link as soon as the preprint is available.",
        "From _Joerg Arndt_, Jul 21 2014: (Start)",
        "Multiply fg=gf from the right by f to obtain fgf=gff, and use f(gf)=f(fg)=ffg to see ffg=gff; iterate to see f^k g = g f^k for all k>=1; by symmetry g^k f = f g^k holds as well.",
        "More generally, if X and Y are words of length w over the alphabet {f,g}, then X = Y (as functional composition) whenever both words contain j symbols f and k symbols g (and j+k=w).  (End)",
