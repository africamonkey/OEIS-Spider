        "Terms must be congruent to 2 or 4 mod 6. Other than the first term, which produces 10^2 + 111 = 211, these terms produce primes whose decimal representation is 1 <n-3 0's> 111 concatenated. These are only known to be highly probable primes for 184 and beyond. No more terms up to 15000."

        "As 10111 = 10^4 + 111 is a prime, 4 is a term."
