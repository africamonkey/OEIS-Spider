    "comment": [
        "Any tree with 2n vertices is a bipartite graph with s vertices in one part and t vertices in the other part, where s <= t and s + t = 2n. We count trees with s = t = n, and which are asymmetric, that is, their only automorphism is the identity automorphism. These are also called identity trees."

    "example": [
        "a(3) = 0 because there are six trees with 6 vertices, but only three of these have s = t = n = 3, and none of these three is asymmetric. The fourth term a(4) = 1 because there are nine trees with 8 vertices with s = t = n = 4 but only 1 is asymmetric, namely tree T46. See \"Atlas of Graphs\", page 65."
