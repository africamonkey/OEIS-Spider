        "This sequence is the union of emirps, emirpimes, \"emirp tsomla-3\", \"emirp tsomla-4\", \"emirp tsomla-5\" and so forth. An emirp (\"prime\" spelled backwards) is a prime whose (base 10) reversal is also prime, but which is not a palindromic prime. The first few are 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97, 107, 113, 149, 157, ... (A006567). An emirpimes (\"semiprime\" spelled backwards) is a semiprime whose (base 10) reversal is a different semiprime. A list of the first emirpimeses (or \"semirpimes\") are 15, 26, 39, 49, 51, 58, 62, 85, 93, 94, 115, 122, 123, ... (A097393). An \"emirp tsomla-3\" (\"3-almost prime\" spelled backwards) is the k=3 sequence of the series for which k=1 are emirps and k=2 are emirpimes, a list of these being A109023. The union of these for k=1 through k = 13 is A109019. The primes correspond to the \"1-almost prime\" numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... (A000040). The 2-almost prime numbers correspond to semiprimes 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, ... (A001358). The first few 3-almost primes are 8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30, 42, 44, 45, 50, 52, 63, 66, 68, 70, 75, 76, 78, 92, 98, 99, ... (A014612). The first few 4-almost primes are 16, 24, 36, 40, 54, 56, 60, 81, 84, 88, 90, 100, ... (A014613). The first few 5-almost primes are 32, 48, 72, 80, ... (A014614).",
