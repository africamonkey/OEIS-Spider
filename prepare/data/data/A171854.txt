    "comment": [
        "A string of consecutive up steps U_1, U_2, ..., U_m and their matching down steps D_1, D_2, ..., D_m are said to form a ladder if (i) D_1, D_2, ..., D_m are consecutive steps and (ii) the sequence of pairs (U_j, D_j) (j=1,2,...,m) is maximal. For example, in the path (UU)[U]H[D]H(DD), where U=(1,1), H=(1,0), D=(1,-1), we have 2 ladders, shown between parentheses and square brackets, respectively (can be easily expressed also in RNA secondary structure terminology)."
