        "Main transitions in systems of n particles with spin 1.",
        "Consider the set S of all b^n numbers which have n digits in base b. Define as \"main transition\" a pair (x,y) of elements of S such that x and y differ in base b in only one digit which in y exceeds that in x by 1. This particular sequence a(n) gives the number of such transitions for the case b=3.",
        "The terminology originates from quantum theory of coupled spin systems (such as in magnetic resonance) with n particles, each with spin S = (b-1)/2. Then the i-th digit's value in base b can be intended as a label for the b = 2S+1 quantum states of the i-th particle. The most intense main quantum transitions then correspond to the above definition. Due to continuity, the correspondence holds regardless of how strongly coupled are the particles among themselves.",
        "a(n) is the number of functions from {1,2,...,n} into {1,2,3} with a specially designated element of the domain that is restricted to be mapped into {1,2}. Hence the e.g.f. is 2*x*exp(x)^3. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Mar 01 2015"
