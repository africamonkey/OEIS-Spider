        "Conjecture 1: this is the number of binary sequences S of length n such that, for all primes p such that p^2 <= n, at least one of the p^2 linearly indexed subsequences of S with gap p^2 starting at the 1st, 2nd, ..., p^2-th position of S, is the all-zeros sequence. In other words, every block that is not explicitly ruled out by congruence conditions for the primes p with p^2 <= n should occur.",
