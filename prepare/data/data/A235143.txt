        "The positions reflect radii which are a unique sum of two and only two distinct nonzero square integers.",
        "The positions are a bit less frequent in occurrence than the positions where the first differences equal 2 because when the radius changes from exactly an integer value k to the open interval (k,k+1), the number of edge squares increase by 2, while in the reverse case, an increase from the open interval (k,k+1) to exactly k+1, the number of edge squares stays the same rather than decreasing by 2 as occurs in cases when the radii are a sum of two and only two distinct nonzero square integers.  This is in contrast to positions where the first difference of A234300 equals 1 which are exactly balanced by positions which equal -1."
