        "Broadhurst calls EPPP, for efficient portmanteau probable primes, the terms a(N) such that for all n <= N, a(n-1) = floor(a(n)/d(a(n))), where d(x)=log(x)*log(log(x)). In this case, the prime a(N) efficiently encodes the whole list of the first N terms of this sequence, via this simple \"unpacking\" formula.",
        "It turns out that the terms are EPPP at least up to N=1000. In this range, the gap delta(n)=a(n)/d(a(n))-a(n-1) takes a maximum of ~ 0.94253 at n=27. For example, the 4407 digit PRP a(1000) \"contains\" the primes a(0), ..., a(1000) with a total of roughly 2 million digits. (As the name indicates, terms listed in the b-file are only PRP.)",
        "Since all terms are odd, one could still consider the encoding \"safe\" as long as delta(n) < 2, i.e., use a(n-1) = floor[a(n)/d(a(n))/2]*2+1. Beyond, one might introduce k-EPPP for an encoding that allows recovery of the preceding terms modulo testing divisibility by p <= k. (This, however, cannot ensure a \"safe\" encoding as soon as delta >= 2: One might well run into the case where a(n-1) is the lesser if a twin prime pair.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 03 2012"
