        "This sequence gives a way to enumerate unrestricted partitions of a number. The number of terms of this sequence that are each >= 2^(k-1) and <= 2^k -1 is equal to the number of unrestricted partitions of k.",
        "Equivalently, numbers in whose binary representation the runs of 1's are in increasing order of length, the runs of 0's are in decreasing order of length, and all runs of 0's are at least as long as any run of 1's. The position of [1^m] in the partitions of m will be P(m-1). It is the last partition in the list with a part of size 1; anything with a part of size 2 or more will start 100... in the binary representation, while this partition starts 101...; and any partition that does not have a part of size 1 will start 11.... Removing one part of size 1 from the partitions of size m that have such a part gives each partition of m-1 uniquely. This relationship is expressed by the second formula of A002865. - _Franklin T.

On the other hand, 23 in binary is 10111. The run-lengths are (1,1,3). But 17 (which is < 23) in binary is 10001, which has the run-lengths of (1,3,1).
