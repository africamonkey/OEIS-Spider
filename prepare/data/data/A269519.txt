    "comment": [
        "Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions suggests that average gaps between primes of the form 8k + 7 below x are about phi(8)*log(x). This sequence shows that the record gap ending at p grows almost as fast as phi(8)*log^2(p). Here phi(n) is A000010, Euler's totient function; phi(8)=4.",

        "A269521 lists the corresponding primes at the end of the maximal gaps."

        "The first two primes of the form 8k + 7 are 7 and 23, so a(1)=23-7=16. The next primes of this form are 31, 47; the gaps 31-23 and 47-31 are not records so nothing is added to the sequence. The next prime of this form is 71 and the gap 71-47=24 is a new record, so a(2)=24."
