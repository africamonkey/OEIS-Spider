        "Let S be the set generated by these rules:  (1) if m and n are in S and m<n, then floor(mr+nr) is in S; (2) two or more specific numbers are in S.  The floor-sum sequence determined by (1) and (2) results by arranging the elements of S in strictly increasing order.",
        "Let B be the Beatty sequence of r. Then a floor-sum sequence of r is a subsequence of B if and only if a(1) and a(2) are terms of B.  Thus, A182669 is a subsequence of the lower Wythoff sequence, A000201."
