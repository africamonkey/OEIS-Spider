    "comment": [
        "Strangely, the first 5 values of this sequence are all primes. Meng proves a remarkable generalization of the Goldbach-Vinogradov classical result that every sufficiently large odd integer N can be partitioned as the sum of three primes N = p1 + p2 + p3. The new proof is that every sufficiently large odd integer N can be partitioned as the sum of three integers N = a + b + c where each of a, b, c has k distinct prime factors for the same k.",
