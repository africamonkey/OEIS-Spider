        "b(n) := (-1)^n*a(n) appears in the formula for the nonpositive powers of rho(9) := 2*cos(Pi/9), when written in the power basis of the algebraic number field Q(rho(9)) of degree 3. See A187360 for the minimal polynomial C(9, x) of rho(9), and a link to the Q(2*cos(pi/n)) paper. 1/rho(9) = -3*1 + 0*rho(9) + 1*rho(9)^2 (see A230079, row n=5). 1/rho(9)^n = b(n)*1 + b(n-2)*rho(9) + b(n-1)*rho(9)^2, n >= 0, with b(-1) = 0 = b(-2). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Nov 04 2013",
        "The limit b(n+1)/b(n) = -a(n+1)/a(n) for n -> infinity is -tau(9) := -(1 + rho(9)) = 1/(2*cos(Pi*5/9)), approximately -2.445622407. tau(9) is known to be the length ratio (longest diagonal)/side in the regular 9-gon. This limit follows from the b(n)-recurrence and the solutions of X^3 + 3*X^2 - 1 = 0, which are given by the inverse of the known solutions of the minimal polynomial C(9, x) of rho(9) (see A187360). The other two X solutions are 1/rho(9) = -3 + rho(9)^2, approximately 0.5320888860 and 1/(2*cos(Pi*7/9)) = 1 + rho(9) - rho(9)^2, approximately -0.6527036445, and they are therefore irrelevant for this sequence. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Nov 08 2013",
        "a(n) is also the number of ternary (0,1,2) sequences of length n without a consecutive '110' because the patterns A=012 and B=110 have the same autocorrelation, i.e., AA=100=BB, in the sense of Guibas and Odlysko (1981).
