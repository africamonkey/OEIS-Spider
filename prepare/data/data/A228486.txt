        "Combined list of prime Euclid numbers and prime Kummer numbers. Comment by \"eigenperson\" in  \"The products of the first n primes are called the primorials. If you add 1 to these, you get the Euclid numbers. If you subtract 1 instead, you get the Kummer numbers. The prime Euclid numbers (or prime Kummer numbers) don't have special names. They are just the 'prime Euclid numbers.' I guess you could call them 'Euclid primes' (or 'Kummer primes') if you wanted to be fancy, but this is not widely-used terminology. You can find a list of the first few prime Euclid numbers on OEIS. I believe the question of whether this list goes on forever is unsolved. As far as I know, the combined list of prime Euclid numbers and prime Kummer numbers has no name (and isn't even on OEIS as far as I can tell).\"",
