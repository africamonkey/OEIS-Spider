For B=Cn+A, A=C^m the number of different cycles z are computed. Every S leads to a cycle, so it can be conjectured that the number of cycles is infinite. But the number of different cycles seems to be finite. It is conjectured that the last new cycle occurs at the starting number S = B. This was tested with A=1; B=3; C=2 up to S=100000000.",
