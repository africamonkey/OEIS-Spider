        "A very simple sieve for the generation of the terms is the following: let p_0=1 and, for n>=1, p_n be the n-th prime. Consider consecutive intervals of the form (2p_n, 2p_{n+1}), n=0,1,2,... From every interval containing at least one prime we remove the last one. Then all remaining primes form the sequence. Let us demonstrate this sieve: For p_n=1,2,3,5,7,11,... consider intervals (2,4), (4,6), (6,10), (10,14), (14,22), (22,26), (26,34), ... . Removing from the set of all primes the last prime of each interval, i.e., 3,5,7,13,19,23,31,... we obtain 2,11,17,29, etc. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Aug 30 2011",

Changing \"k\" to \"k-1\" and therefore \"k+1\" to \"k\" produces a definition very similar to A164333's: it differs by prefixing an initial term 3.
