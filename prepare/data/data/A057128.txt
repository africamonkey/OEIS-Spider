        "The fact that there are no numbers in this sequence of the form 6k+5 leads to the result that all prime factors of central polygonal numbers (A002061 of the form n^2-n+1) are either 3 or of the form 6k+1. This in turn leads to there being an infinite number of primes of the form 6k+1, since if P=product[all known primes of form 6k+1] then all the prime factors of 9P^2-3P+1 must be unknown primes of form 6k+1.",
