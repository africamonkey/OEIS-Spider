        "In other words, pure hailstone numbers that are also primes (primes in A061641).",
        "Impure hailstone numbers occur in the trajectories of smaller numbers, using the definition C(n) = (3n+1, n odd; n/2 if n is even). The set of pure hailstone numbers and the subset of pure, prime hailstone numbers; may be obtained through a process of elimination. The rules [cf. Shaw, p. 199] for A127928(n>1) force the terms to be == 1 or 7 mod 18; but not all primes mod 1 or 7 are in A127928. (e.g. 61 == 7 mod 18 and is prime but is not a pure hailstone number).",
        "Shaw, p. 199: If n == 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 mod 18, then n is pure, but only 3 is prime. If n == 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16 or 17 mod 18, then n is impure. If n == 1 or 7 mod 18, then n may be pure or impure."
