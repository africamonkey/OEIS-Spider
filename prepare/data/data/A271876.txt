        "This sequence is finite.",
        "If 3^n = x^3 + y^3 + z^3, then 3^(n+3) = 3^3 * 3^n = 3^3 * (x^3 + y^3 + z^3) = (3*x)^3 + (3*y)^3 + (3*z)^3. So if we can find the integer n such that 3^n, 3^(n+1) and 3^(n+2) are sums of 3 positive cubes, we will exactly know that this sequence must be finite. Obviously, the minimum value of n such that 3^n, 3^(n+1) and 3^(n+2) are sums of 3 positive cubes determines the last term of this sequence. Since we can solve the 3^n = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 for n = 21, 22, 23 as in example section, all terms of this sequence is computed in limited range that is 0 <= n <= 20.",
