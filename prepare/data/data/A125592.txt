        "Numbers n such that the Maple command genpoly(n,2,t) outputs a polynomial in F_2[t] that is divisible by t(t+1), where F_2 is the finite field with two elements. E.g. a(2)=10 since the polynomial genpoly(10,2,t)=t^3+t = t(t+1)(t+1) in F_2[t] is divisible by the polynomial t(t+1) in F_2[t]",
