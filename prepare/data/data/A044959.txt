        "The terms in the database for this sequence (a) also match two other descriptions: (b) numbers with a majority of one digit and (c) numbers with a plurality of one digit. These sequences diverge at 1002, which is in (c) but not (a) or (b); the first difference between (a) and (b) is 10002, in (b) but not (a). 100012 is the first number in (a) but not (b). (a) and (b) are both subsequences of (c). - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Sep 05 2006"
