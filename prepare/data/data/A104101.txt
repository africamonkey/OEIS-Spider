        "These numbers were central to the plot of the TV-series \"Lost\", episodes 18 and 201.",
        "Another number in the sequence, perhaps the next one, is 540: the number of days which the team of two people who are addressed by the orientation film are to stay at station 3. 4+8+15+16+23+42 = 108 * 5 = 540 - Joshua Walton (joshuawalton<nospam>(AT)hotmail.com), May 05 2006",
        "According to the show, 108 is not officially a part of the sequence, it just happens to be the sum of those numbers. - Ville Saalo (vsaalo(AT)iki.fi), Nov 19 2006",
        "For n = 0,1,2,3,4,5 (1/120)(42n^5 - 305n^4 + 1100n^3 - 895n^2 + 1018n + 480) gives 4,12,35,89,213,511 -- the binomial transform of 4,8,15,16,23,42. The sequence continues 1194,2622,5346,10150,18093.... The polynomial (1/120)(42x^5 - 305x^4 + 1100x^3 - 895x^2 + 1018x + 480) is the \"Shaw-Basho polynomial\". - _Ross La Haye_, Feb 26 2007"
