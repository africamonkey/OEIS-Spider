        "Let f(n, j), 1 < j <= k, be the number of ways of making change for n cents with coin values c(i), 1 <= i <= j. Then any number m of c(j)-coins with 0 <= m <= floor(n/c(j)) can be used, and the remaining amount of change to be made using coins of values smaller than c(j) will be n - m*c(j) cents. This leads directly to the recurrence formula with a(n) = f(n, k).",
