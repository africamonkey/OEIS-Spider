        "These numbers are exactly the numbers of the form 2^a * p * m^2 where p is a prime number congruent to 1 modulo 4, a is a nonnegative integer, and m is a positive integer coprime to p. In particular, they are also sums of two squares: the sequence has the first 12 terms in common with A132777."
