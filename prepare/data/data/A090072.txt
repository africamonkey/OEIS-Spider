        "For all terms given above each palindrome is reached from the preceding one or from the start in at most 35 steps; after the presumably last one no further palindrome is reached in 5000 steps.",
        "Only two numbers are known whose Reverse and Add trajectory contains twelve palindromes: 10000 and 10001. It is conjectured that these are the only such numbers and it has been conjectured before (cf. A077594) that no Reverse and Add trajectory contains more than twelve palindromes."
