    "comment": [
        "In contrast to A225376-A225378, here it is not required (and not true) that each number should appear just once in P union Q union R. On the other hand, again in contrast to A225376-A225378, here it is obvious that P, Q, R are infinite.",
        "The first three numbers that are repeated are 284, 2074, 3500, which appear in both P and Q. There may be no others. Of course R is disjoint from P and Q, by definition."
