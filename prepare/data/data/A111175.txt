        "Encoded primes with LSD 1 and (SOD-1)/3 integer, (LSD, least significant digit; SOD, sum of digits). Divide any such number by 30, if the whole number portion of the quotient is in the sequence, the number is prime. Example: 2671, with LSD 1 and (SOD-1)/3 = 2 (integer); Then 2671/30 = 89.033, or 89, which is in the sequence, and thus 2671 is prime. - _Ki Punches_, Mar 18 2009"
