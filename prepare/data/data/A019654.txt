        "An answer to this comment: I would also like to get the sequences that give the maximal value of N. What is the maximum number of queens that can be placed on an n*n chessboard such that no two attack one another? The answer is n queens, which gives eight queens for the usual 8*8 board (Madachy 1979; Steinhaus 1999, p. 29). The number of different ways the n queens can be placed on an n*n chessboard so that no two queens may attack each other for the first few n are 1, 0, 0, 2, 10, 4, 40, 92, ...
