        "Subsequence of A033560. The triples have the form (p,p+d,p+2d). The current sequence (d=24) continues A023241 (d=6), A185022 (d=12) and A156109 (d=18). The frequencies of such triples and the triple (p, p+3\u00b11, p+6) in A007529 do not differ very much (see table in the link \"comparison of triples\"). For creating the b-file I used a file of prime differences, divided by 2 (extension of A028334). For filling the table I analyzed primes up to 10^9.",
        "Annotation: The algorithm using a file of primes or prime differences is not difficult but not as easy as using a function like isprime(n). On the other hand, such a function needs computing time which is not negligible for large numbers."
