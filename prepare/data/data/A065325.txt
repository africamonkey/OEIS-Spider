        "The number of steps starts at 0, so palindromes (cf. A002113) are excluded. 78 is a record (cf. A065199) of the number of 'Reverse and Add' steps needed to reach a palindrome.",
        "First term not congruent to 15 mod 18 is a(135) = 2000688, thereafter residues 6 and 15 appear in larger clusters; first residue different from 15 and 6 is at a(1215) = 16902780. - Klaus Brockhaus, Jul 14 2003"
