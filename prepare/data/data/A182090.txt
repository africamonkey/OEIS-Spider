        "Conjecture: Any Carmichael number C divisible by 11 and not divisible by 3 can be written in one of the following four forms: C = 990k+11; C = 990k+11^2; C = 990k+11*41 or C = 990k+11*71, where k is a natural number.",
        "In other words, C mod 990 can be, for C divisible by 11 and not divisible by 3, just 11; 11^2; 11*41 or 11*71.",
        "For comparison, we issue the following related conjectures:",
        "(1) Any Carmichael number C of the form 10n+1 divisible by 7 and not divisible by 3 and 5 can be written in one of the following three forms: C = 630k+7*13; C = 630k+7*43; C = 7*73.",
        "(2) Any Carmichael number C of the form 10n+3, 10n+7 or 10n+9 divisible by 7 and not divisible by 3 and 5 can be written as C = 630k+7^3, C = 630k+7*31 or C = 630k+7*67.",
        "(3) Any Carmichael number C divisible same time with 7 and 11 can be written as C = 7*11*90*k + 7*11*n, where n can be 23, 53 or 83.",
        "Note: there exist Carmichael numbers that can be written as C = p*(90k+1) for every p prime divisor of C.",
        "Example:",
        "C = 197531244744661; C mod 90*1531 = 1531; C mod 90*3061 = 3061; C mod 90*4591 = 4591; C mod 90*9181 = 9181.",
        "The first counterexample to the conjecture is 6049681 which is 781 mod 990. 341 and 671 mod 990 also appear. Conjecture 1 is true; the only excluded possibility is 161 mod 210 which is never a 2-pseudoprime (check mod 7). All three parts of conjecture 2 are false; counterexamples include 461502097, 1378483393, and 7044493729. Conjecture 3 is true, consider Korselt's criterion mod 30. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Dec 07 2014"
