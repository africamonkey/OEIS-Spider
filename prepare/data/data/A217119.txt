    "comment": [
        "The sequence is well-defined in that for each n the set of numbers with n nonprime substrings is not empty and finite. Proof of existence: Define m(n):=2*sum_{j=i..k} 9^j, where k:=floor((sqrt(8n+1)-1)/2), i:= n-(k(k+1)/2). For n=0,1,2,3,... the m(n) in base-9 representation are  2, 22, 20, 222, 220, 200, 2222, 2220, 2200, 2000, 22222, 22220, .... m(n) has k+1 digits and (k-i+1) 2\u2019s. Thus, the number of nonprime substrings of m(n) is ((k+1)(k+2)/2)-k-1+i=(k(k+1)/2)+i=n. This proves the statement of existence. Proof of finiteness: Each 3-digit base-9 number has at least 1 nonprime substring. Hence, each 3(n+1)-digit number has at least n+1 nonprime substrings. Consequently, there is a boundary b < 9^(3n+2) such that all numbers > b have more than n nonprime substrings. It follows, that the set of numbers with n nonprime substrings is finite."
