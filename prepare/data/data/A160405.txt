        "Haiku-haiku-haiku primes. I would like to call these \"Haiku primes\" but it seems that name has been used by _Geoffrey Caveney_ for a different concept. Another possible name would be haiku-formed primes, but maybe that should be reserved for primes which are formed from any number of primes of width 5 or 7. Note that if you associate the hyphens with the central word, Haiku-haiku-haiku is itself of the 5-7-5 form (in characters)."
