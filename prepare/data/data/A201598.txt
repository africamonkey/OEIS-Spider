    "comment": [
        "Prime triplets (p, p+2, p+6) are one of the two types of densest permissible constellations of 3 primes (A022004 and A022005). By the Hardy-Littlewood k-tuple conjecture, average gaps between prime k-tuples are O(log^k(p)), with k=3 for triplets. If a gap is larger than any preceding gap, we call it a maximal gap, or a record gap. Maximal gaps may be significantly larger than average gaps; this sequence suggests that maximal gaps between triplets are O(log^4(p)).",
        "A201599 lists initial primes p in triplets (p, p+2, p+6) preceding the maximal gaps. A233434 lists the corresponding primes p at the end of the maximal gaps."

    "formula": [
        "Gaps between prime triplets (p, p+2, p+6) are smaller than 0.35*(log p)^4, where p is the prime at the end of the gap. There is no rigorous proof of this formula. The O(log^4(p)) growth rate is suggested by numerical data and heuristics based on probability considerations."
    ],
    "example": [
        "The gap of 6 between triplets starting at p=5 and p=11 is the very first gap, so a(1)=6. The gap of 6 between triplets starting at p=11 and p=17 is not a record, so it does not contribute to the sequence. The gap of 24 between triplets starting at p=17 and p=41 is a maximal gap - larger than any preceding gap; therefore a(2)=24."
