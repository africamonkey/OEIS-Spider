    "comment": [
        "As explained in the comments in A269318, the terms of A269319 are discriminants of quadratic fields K which correspond to certain quartets (L_1,...L_4) of pairwise non-isomorphic non-Galois cubic fields sharing a common fundamental discriminant d(L_i)=d(K). There occur 5 of these quartets in [Angell] (up to 10^5), 58 in [Ennola, Turunen] (up to 5*10^5), and 2576 in [Llorente, Quer] (up to 10^7). It should be pointed out that, whereas [Angell] does not contain other quartets than the 5 corresponding to type (3,3), there occur 3 further quartets associated with type (9,3) in [Ennola, Turunen], namely 255973, 282461, 384369. In [Llorente, Quer], we have 271 additional quartets of type (9,3), 20 of type (27,3), 1 of type (81,3), and 2 of type (9,9). The splitting 2879-9=2870=2576+271+20+1+2 was computed in [Mayer, 2010] and is not contained in [Llorente, Quer]. The number 2576 was published in [Mayer, 2012] and is not mentioned in [Llorente, Quer]. The most recent and most extensive information is due to [Bush], who showed that there are 415698 quartets associated with type (3,3) up to the bound 10^9."
