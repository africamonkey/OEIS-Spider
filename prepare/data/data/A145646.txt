        "The series for n=1, 2 etc. are named after Lyman, Balmer, etc.",
        "The sequence is ill-defined since it depends on the incompletely known natural constant A081821. Although the sequence is essentially proportional to n^2, rounding effects prevent high-term predictability of the differences. Taking relativistic corrections into account will worsen the situation. - _R. J. Mathar_, Oct 17 2008"
