        "a(n) is the largest odd Egyptian fraction as yet unused, such that the sum of the Egyptian fractions so far does not exceed 1. The sum of a(n) is a greedy representation (greedy because each step bites off as much as possible) of 1, using only odd Egyptian fractions, all distinct.",
        "Terms a(11)-a(13) were found by David Eppstein (see posting from Nov 09 1996), who says that he found them by applying EgyptOddGreedy[2/3,5] from his Egyptian fractions notebook."
