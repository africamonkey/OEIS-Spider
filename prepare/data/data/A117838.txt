        "Contains all sequences with primes that are followed by a prime gap which is a multiple of 18 - since adding multiples of 9 does not change the digital root and the gaps are even. So A031936 (gap 18) and A134117 (gap 36) are subsequences and lower primes of prime gap 54 (35617, 40289, 40639, 86869, 100853,...), prime gap 72 (31397, 360091, 507217, 517639, 633667, 650107, 705317....) or prime gap 90 (404851,576791,..), for example, are also in here (cf. A000230). - _R. J. Mathar_, Apr 14 2008"
