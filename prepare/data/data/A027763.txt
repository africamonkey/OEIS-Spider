        "This sequence shares many terms with A056637, the least prime of class n-. Note that 3^(n-1) is an upper bound for each term and the upper bound is reached for n=13 and n=14. Are all subsequent terms 3^(n-1)? The Mathematica code uses the TowerMod function in the CNT package, which is described in the book by Bressoud and Wagon. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 13 2009",
