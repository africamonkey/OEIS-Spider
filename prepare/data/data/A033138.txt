        "Here we let p = 3 to produce the above sequence, but p can be an arbitrary natural number. By letting p = 2, 4, 6, 7 we produce A000975, A083593, A195904 and A117302. We denote by U[p,n,m] the number of cases in which the first player in a game of Russian roulette gets killed when p players use a gun with n chambers and m bullets. They never rotate the cylinder after the game starts.",
        "The chambers can be represented by the list {1,2,...,n}. We are going to calculate the following (0), (1),...(t) separately. (0) The first player gets killed when one bullet is in the first chamber and the remaining (m-1)- bullets are in {2,3,...,n}. We have binomial(n-1,m-1) cases for this. (1) The first gets killed when one bullet is in the (p+1)st chamber and the rest of the bullets are in {p+2,..,n}. We have binomial(n-p-1,m-1) cases for this. We continue to calculate and the last is (t), where t = floor((n-m)/p). (t) The first gets killed when one bullet is in the (pt+1)st chamber and the remaining bullets are in {pt+2,...,n}. We have binomial(n-pt-1,m-1) cases for this.",
        "Therefore U[p,n,m] = Sum_{z=0..t} binomial(n-pz-1,m-1), where t = floor((n-m)/p). Let A[p,n] be the number of the cases in which the first player gets killed when p players use a gun with n chambers and the number of bullets can be from 1 to n. Then A[p,n] = Sum_{m=1..n} U[p,n,m]. - _Ryohei Miyadera_, Tomohide Hashiba, Yuta Nakagawa, Hiroshi Matsui, Jun 04 2006",
