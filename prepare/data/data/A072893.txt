    "name": "Let c(k) be defined as follows: c(1)=1, c(2)=x, c(k+2) = c(k+1)/2 + c(k)/2 if c(k+1) and c(k) have the same parity; c(k+2) = c(k+1) - c(k) otherwise. Sequence gives values of x such that c(k)=1 for any k large enough.",

        "Conjectures: (1) Lim n ->infinity a(n)/n = C = 3.5.... (2) For any n > 2, a(n+1)-a(n) = 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 or 10 only. First differences a(n+1)-a(n) for n>2 are 3, 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 5, 3, 2, 10, 3, 5, 2, 3, 2, 8... (3) If x is not in this sequence, for k large enough, c(k)= -1 or c(k) reaches one of the two cycles {3, 1, 2, -1} or {0, -1, 1, 0, 1, -1}."
