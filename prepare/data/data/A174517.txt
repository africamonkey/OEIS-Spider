        "Partial sums of number of self-avoiding walks on square lattice trapped after n steps. Through a(28) the only prime value is 3. A self-trapping walk is a walk which ends when the walker is \"trapped\" or surrounded by previously visited sites on the lattice. Every step before trapping generates a self-avoiding walk, but there is a very subtle difference in the probability measures."
