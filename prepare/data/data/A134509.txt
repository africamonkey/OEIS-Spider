        "Let \"s\" be any sequence (finite or infinite) and \"b\" be any set of real numbers. Define an operation 'triangular removal', TriRem(s,b), that produces a subsequence from s as follows: Arrange the terms s(i) by rows into a triangle, which can be viewed as a (possibly infinite) set of nested \"^\"-shaped layers. Count each layer from the outside as layer 1, 2, 3, .... During the following removal process, these layer numbers are considered fixed: For each positive integer n in b, remove layer n if it exists. TriRem(s,b) is the sequence of remaining terms read by rows. The current sequence, A134509, is TriRem(A000217-{0},A000217). A complementary operation 'triangular retention', TriRet(s,b), can be defined similarly that instead retains the layers specified by b. The index of an original term s(i) at the apex of a removed/retained \"^\"-layer is a centered square number (A001844)."
