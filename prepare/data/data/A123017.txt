        "When a(n+1) = a(n) + 3 we have that a(n) is a semiprime such that a(n) and a(n)+3 and a(n) + 3 + 3 are all semiprimes, hence at least 3 semiprimes in arithmetic progression with common difference 3. This subsequence begins 115, 155. There cannot be 4 semiprimes in arithmetic progression with common difference 3, starting with k, because modulo 4 we have {k, k+3, k+6, k+9} == {k+0, k+3, k+2, k+1} and one of these must be divisible by 4, hence a nonsemiprime (eliminating k = 4 by inspection)."
