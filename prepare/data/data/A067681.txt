Diagonals can also be specified, where the m-th diagonal consists of the infinite number of elements B(m,1), B(m+1,2), B(m+2,3), ... The m-th antidiagonal of the array consists of the m elements B(m,1), B(m-1,2), B(m-2,3), ..., B(1,m).",

        "Thus each composite has its own row, consisting of the indices of its prime factors. For example, the 10th composite is 18 and 18 = 2^1 * 3^2 * 5^0 * 7^0 * 11^0 * ..., so the 10th row reads: 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ..., . Similarly, B(6,2) = 1 because c(6) = 12, p(2) = 3 and the highest power of 3 contained within 12 is 3^1 = 3. And B(34,3) = 2 because c(34) = 50, p(3) = 5 and the highest power of 5 contained within 50 is 5^2 = 25."
