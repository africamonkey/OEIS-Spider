        "Any run of 8 or more consecutive integers must include at least one number k of the form 8j+4; in the prime factorization of k, the prime factor 2 appears with multiplicity exactly 2, so the number of divisors of k is divisible by 3 (which is not a power of 2). Thus, there is no term a(8): the sequence is complete, ending with a(7). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Nov 12 2017"
