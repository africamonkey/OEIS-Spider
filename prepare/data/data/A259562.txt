        "It would follow from the generalized Bunyakovsky conjecture that, e.g., there are infinitely many primes p such that p+2, p+12, p+14, 6*p^2+84*p+1 and 6*p^2+84*p+145 are all prime, and there are no primes between 6*p^2+84*p+1 and 6*p^2+84*p+145. If so, then the sequence is infinite, because it contains n where prime(n) = 6*p^2+84*p+1, with prime(n)-1 having distinct prime factors 2,3,p,p+14 and prime(n+1) having distinct prime factors 2,3,p+2,p+12. - _Robert Israel_, Jun 30 2015"
