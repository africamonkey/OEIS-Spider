        "The Engel expansion of 1/Pi is given in A014012 and the Pierce (or alternating Engel) expansion of 1/Pi is found in A006283.",
        "We can unify the algorithms for finding the Engel and Pierce expansions of a real number as follows.",

        "Then the sequence of positive integers e(n) := ceiling(1/f^(n)(r)) is the Engel expansion of r. The associated Engel series representation is r = 1/e(0) + 1/(e(0)*e(1)) + 1/(e(0)*e(1)*e(2)) + ....",
        "The sequence of positive integers p(n) := |ceiling(1/f^(n)(-r))| is the Pierce expansion of r. The associated Pierce series representation is r = 1/p(0) - 1/(p(0)*p(1)) + 1/(p(0)*p(1)*p(2)) - ....",
        "By working with a modification of the map f we can find two generalized Engel-type expansions for the real number r (still assuming 0 < r < 1). To this end, we define the map g:[-1,1]\\{0} -> (-1/2,1) by g(x) = -x*ceiling(-1/x) - 1 and let g^(n)(x) denote the n-th iterate of g, with the convention that g^(0)(x) = x.",
        "A)",
        "Our first generalized expansion of r is the integer sequence a(n) := |ceiling(1/g^(n)(r))| for n >= 0 and until g^n(r) = 0. It can be shown that we have a generalized Engel-type representation for r by means of the (possibly infinite) series r = 1/a(0) - 1/(a(0)*a(1)) - 1/(a(0)*a(1)*a(2)) + 1/(a(0)*a(1)*a(2)*a(3)) + 1/(a(0)*a(1)*a(2)*a(3)*a(4)) - - + + ..., where the pattern of signs of the terms is as indicated.",
        "The series will be finite if and only if r is rational.",

        "The second generalized Engel expansion of r is defined as the sequence of integers b(n) := |ceiling(1/g^(n)(-r))| for n >= 0 and until g^(n)(-r) = 0.",
        "It can be shown that we now have a generalized Engel-type representation for r of the form r = 1/b(0) + 1/(b(0)*b(1)) - 1/(b(0)*b(1)*b(2)) - 1/(b(0)*b(1)*b(2)*b(3)) + + - - ....",
        "Again, the series terminates when r is rational, otherwise it is infinite.",
        "See A232328 for the generalized Engel expansion of 1/Pi of the second kind.",
        "We can generalize the Engel and Pierce expansions of a real number even further by considering series expansions to a base b. See A232325 for a definition and details. The usual Engel and Pierce expansions occur when the base b = 1 and the two generalized Engel expansions described above arise when the base b = -1."
