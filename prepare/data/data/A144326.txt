        "Conjecture: 191, 1217, 1559 and 1901 are not in fact members of this sequence, noting that they are (4, 19) k-figurate numbers; 19 is a member of A138694. Determining whether a Mersenne prime exponent one greater than a (4, 19) k-figurate number exists is sufficient to determine whether these primes are members."
