A solution, which includes a general formula, can be found in Crux Mathematicorum, Vol. 24 #7 (November 1998): a(n) = floor (((n + x_n) / 2)^2 + 1), where x_n = floor (n + 1 - 2 sqrt (n - 1)).",

        "\"The problem was also solved by Peter Tingley (then an undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario), who gave the alternate formula: a(n) = n y_n + floor ((n - y_n)^2 / 4 + 1), where y_n = floor (n - 2 sqrt(n - 1) + 1), which 'is readily seen to be the same as the one obtained by Herzig.'\""
