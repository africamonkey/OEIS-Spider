    "comment": [
        "Since S_{n+1} is a product of a subgroup isomorphic to S_n and the cyclic group <(1,2,3,...,n+1)> we have a(n+1) <= a(n) + 1. On the other hand it is not clear that a(n) <= a(n+1) for all n. A lower bound is given by A226143(n) = ceiling(log(m)(n!)), m = A000793(n), a sequence that is not nondecreasing.",
