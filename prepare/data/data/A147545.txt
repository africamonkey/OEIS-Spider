        "This sequence starts like A074781 but grows much faster. Observe that there can be large differences between consecutive terms. Can it be shown that there is always such a prime between consecutive powers of 2? Or that this sequence is infinite? By theorem 1 of the Noe paper, this sequence is a subsequence of A135832, primes in Section I of the phi iteration."
