        "The structure is essentially one of the vertical wedges of several D-toothpick structures. For more information see A220500. First differs from A194440 at a(14). The first differences (A220521) give the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage. See A220522 for the \"narrow\" triangle of the third kind."
