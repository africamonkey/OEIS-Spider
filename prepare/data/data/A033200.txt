        "Fermat knew of the relationship between a prime being congruent to 1 or 3 mod 8 and its being the sum of a square and twice a square, and claimed to have a firm proof of this fact. These numbers are not primes in Z[sqrt(-2)], as they have x - y sqrt(-2) as a divisor. - _Alonso del Arte_, Dec 07 2012",

        "This sequence gives the primes p which satisfy norm(rho(p)) = + 1 with rho(p) := 2*cos(Pi/p) (the length ratio (smallest diagonal)/side in the regular p-gon). The norm of an algebraic number (over Q) is the product over all zeros of its minimal polynomial. Here norm(rho(p)) = (-1)^delta(p)* C(p, 0), with the degree delta(p) = A055034(p) = (p-1)/2. For the minimal polynomial C see A187360. For p == 1 (mod 8) the norm is C(p, 0) (see a comment on 4*A005123) and for p == 3 (mod 8) the norm is -C(p, 0) (see a comment on A186297). For the primes with norm(rho(p)) = -1 see A003628. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 24 2013",
