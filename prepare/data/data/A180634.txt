An equivalent characterization of the latter (apart from n=2): n such that the number of square roots of 1 mod n is divisible by 4. (See comments at A033949). - _Robert Israel_, Dec 08 2014",
        "To see this, use Gauss's generalization of Wilson's theorem namely, the product of the units of Z_n is -1 if n is 4 or p^i or 2p^i for odd primes p, i >0,  and is equal to 1 otherwise. - _W. Edwin Clark_, Dec 09 2014"
