The complex zeros are z_0(k) = x_0(k) + y_0(k)*I, with x_0(k) = (k+1/2)*alpha and y_0(k) = (k+1/2)*a, where  alpha and a appear in the Fibonacci case as alpha = 2*(Pi^2)/(Pi^2 + (2*log(phi))^2) and a = 4*Pi*log(phi)/(Pi^2 + (2*log(phi))^2). The x_0 and y_0 values are shifted compared to the zeros of the Fibonacci case by alpha/2, respectively a/2. Approximately alpha/2 = 0.9142023915 and a/2 = 0.2800649542."
