    "comment": [
        "This sequence consists of the divisors of the set of primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 13} highlighted by Paul H. Frampton and Thomas W. Kephart in their 1999 paper \"Mersenne Primes, Polygonal Anomalies and String Theory Classification.\"",
        "Some unique properties of this sequence (not mentioned in the paper) include:",
        "This sequence is the set of divisors of the unique prime divisors of 196560 = {2, 3, 5, 7, 13}, the number of vertices of the 24-dimensional Leech lattice.",
        "This sequence are the prime number indices of Euler's \"Lucky\" numbers (A014556) = {2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41}. It follows that 4*p_A217396(n) - 1 = {7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163} are the last six Heegner numbers (A003173).",
        "This sequence is the complete set of k in N such that d(k) < 3 and d(k - 1) = Pi(k); d(k) the divisor count function and Pi(k) the prime counting function (see A217442).",
        "Pi(A217396) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6} is the complete set of k in N such that 2cos((360 degrees)/(k^(sgn(k)) radians)) is in Z. Therefore, for k > 0, then + or - Pi(A217396) are the allowable n-fold (periodic) rotational symmetries of a crystal by the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem.",
        "This sequence is the complete set of k in N such that k^2 + 11 divides 360. For example, 360/(1^2 + 11) = 30 and 360/(13^2 + 11) = 2.",
        "Observation: Let x = floor[(a(n) - 1)/2], y = the x-th quarter-square = floor[x^2/4], and z = y^2 + y^(n(mod 2)). Then x = {0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6}, y = {0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 9} and z = {1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 90} = A215797|n-1|, where A215797 are the indices of the Ramanujan-Nagell triangular numbers (A076046).",
        "Conjecture: This sequence is the complete set of k in N such that 2^k - 2 is a) twice/1 a triangular number (see A076046), b) thrice/2 a tetrahedral number (see A217482), or c) both. No other such k in N exists to at least 1.41*10^1505 per computer check by _Charles R Greathouse IV_ on Physics Forums (Nov 2010)."
