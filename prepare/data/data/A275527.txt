        "Let us consider two permutations to be equivalent if they can be obtained from each other by cyclic rotation (12345->(23451,34512,45123,51234) or n+1-complement (31254->35412), or a combination of those two transformations (they commute with each other). a(n) is the number of classes.",
        "We obtain the same number of classes if the transformations are (addition of a constant modulo n and reversal (12345->54321)) but not the same set of representatives.",
        "It seems probable that a(2n+1) = (2n)!/2",
        "This sequence may be related to A113247 (and A113248) as they share a common dissection 1, 4, 64, 2544, 181632. The fact that they count permutation classes for the major index is a further indication."
