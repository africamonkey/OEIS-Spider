        "Rabin has shown that the proportion has an upper bound of 0.25. If the trivial non-witnesses are counted, this upper bound is reached at 9. If the conjecture is true that the later terms are always the product of two primes p and (2*p-1), then the sequence continues 188191 218791 269011 286903 385003 497503 597871 736291 765703 954271 1056331 1314631 1869211 2741311 3270403 3913003 4255903 4686391 5292631.",
