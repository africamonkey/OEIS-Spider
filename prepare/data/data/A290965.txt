    "comment": [
        "Sequence is a semigroup, since it is closed under multiplication, an associative operation--in fact, it is provably superclosed, i.e., a product of a term in sequence and an arbitrary number is a term in the sequence since the preexisting primes will still be in the new number.",
        "Density: There are 28 terms in the sequence less than 100. Using WolframAlpha, 72% of numbers from 10^20 + 1 through 10^20 + 50 were found to be in the sequence.",
        "Other facts: No primes or prime powers are in the sequence.",
        "Related sequences: Some other sequences that are superclosed semigroups are the counting numbers, the numbers that are not squarefree, and the numbers with initial product in factorization greater than a later prime in the factorization. (See crossrefs.)"
