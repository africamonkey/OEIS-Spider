        "rad(n) is the product of the distinct primes dividing n (A007947). sigma(n) is the sum of divisors of n (A000203). The odd numbers in this sequence are rare: 1, 135, 891, 1521, 3375, 5733, 10935, 11907, 41067, 43875, ...",
        "Also numbers n such that n divides sigma(n)^tau(n). - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Nov 09 2013",
        "This sequence is infinite. It contains an infinite number of even elements and an infinite number of odd ones. This is due to the fact that for every odd prime p and every prime q dividing p+1, p*q^r is prime-perfect when r = -1 + the multiplicative order of q modulo p. - _Emmanuel Vantieghem_, Oct 13 2014",
        "For each term, it is possible to find an exponent k such that sigma(n)^k is divisible by n. A007691 (multi-perfect numbers) is a subsequence of terms that have k=1. A263928 is the subsequence of terms that have k=2. - _Michel Marcus_, Nov 03 2015"
