    "comment": [
        "The string can be too short to have either 3 total 2's or 4 total 1's, because the batter can be out in various ways, or on base in various ways (hit by pitched ball, balk) before the at-bat ends with strikout or walk. A proper subset of A007931."

        "11111 is the lexicographically earliest element of A007931 without a 2 not in this sequence, since after 4 balls the batter walks and there is no 5th pitch in the at-bat. Technically, this sequence contains the null string (the batter is out without a pitch being thrown, in several ways) but that is not properly represented as a string of 1s and 2s in OEIS."
