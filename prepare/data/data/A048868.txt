        "Let b(n) = differences of a(n). Many of the terms in b(n) are in A060735(n), i.e., b(n) >= A002110(n) and divisible by A002110(n). The smallest b(n) that is not in A060735 is b(450) = 66; b(450) > A002110(n) but not divisible by it; instead it is divisible by A002110(n-1). b(n) seems to \"prefer\" values of A002110(n) as n increases. There is a run of 22 values of 2 starting at b(2), of 22 values of 6 starting at b(178), of 7 values of 210 starting at b(543), and 3 values of 2310 starting at b(577). In the case of A002110(n) with n < 3, the length of runs of A002110(n) is greater than that of runs of any other number of comparable magnitude. The last observed position of A002110(n) in b(n) is {201, 442, (557), ...}.",
        "Questions: are there increasingly more terms such that b(n) is not in A060735 as n increases? Are terms such that b(n) is in A060735 prevalent? Why does b(n) seem to \"prefer\" values in A002110 at certain magnitudes of n as n increases? Are there differences of a(n) = A002110(k) at positions greater than those observed, and if not, why?
