        "The maximum subrange sum of an array x = x[1..n] is the maximum possible value of the sum of the entries in x[a..b] for 1 <= a <= b <= n.  The empty subrange has sum 0 and is also allowed.  For example, the maximum subrange sum of (-1,1,1,1,-1,-1,1, 1, 1, -1) is 4.",
        "Thus a(n)/2^n is the expected value of the maximum subrange sum.  Heuristically this expected value should be approximately sqrt(n), but I don't have a rigorous proof."
