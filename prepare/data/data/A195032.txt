        "Zero together with partial sums of A195031.",
        "The spiral contains infinitely many Pythagorean triples in which the hypotenuses on the main diagonal are the positives multiples of 13 (Cf. A008595). The vertices on the main diagonal are the numbers A195037 = (5+12)*A000217 = 17*A000217, where both 5 and 12 are the first two edges in the spiral. The distance \"a\" between nearest edges that are perpendicular to the initial edge of the spiral is 5, while the distance \"b\" between nearest edges that are parallel to the initial edge is 12, so the distance \"c\" between nearest vertices on the same axis is 13 because from the Pythagorean theorem we can write c = (a^2+b^2)^(1/2) = sqrt(5^2+12^2) = sqrt(25+144) = sqrt(169) = 13. - Omar E.
