        "Extension of the Kaprekar numbers (A006886) where the number of parts of n^2 is two. It is probably possible to generalize this property with the division of n^2 into m parts.",
        "By convention, the second and third parts may start with the digit 0, but must be positive. For example, 991 is in the sequence because 991^2 = 982081, which can be split into 982, 08 and 1, and 982 + 08 + 1 = 991. But 100 is not; although 100^2 = 10000 and 100 + 0 + 0 = 100, the second and the third part here are not positive. The number 99 is not in the sequence although 99^2 = 9801 and 98 + 0 + 1 = 99.",

        "The sequence is infinite because the numbers of the form 10^n-9 = 91, 991, 991, ... (A170955) are in the sequence: if m = 99...91 with k digits \"9\", then m^2 = 99...98200...081 with k-1 digits \"9\" and k-1 digits \"0\", and 99...982 + 00...8 + 1 = 99...91 = m.",

        "Calculation method: For each class of squares having k-digit numbers, the number of partitions into 3 parts is n(n+1)/2 (A000217). For instance, if the numbers are of the form (abcde) with k = 5, the 6 partitions into 3 subsets are {a,b,{c,d,e}}, {a,{b,c},{d,e}}, {a,{b,c,d},e}, {{a,b},c,{d,e}}, {{a,b},{c,d},e}, {{a,b,c},d,e} and then we compute the corresponding numbers.",
