        "This is an E-toothpick sequence. On a triangular graph paper consider an infinite 60-degree wedge in which there is a single (and virtual) toothpick connected to its vertex. At stage 0 we start with no E-toothpicks. At stage 1 we place an E-toothpick, and so on. The sequence gives the number of E-toothpicks in the structure after n stages. A211974 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage. The structure is the tree that arise from one of the six spokes of the structure of A213360 which is essentially the same as the E-toothpick (or snowflake) structure of A161330. For n >> 1 the structure looks like a quadrilateral formed by two scalene right triangles which are joined at their hypotenuses. - _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 19 2012"
