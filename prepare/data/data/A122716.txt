        "p and q cannot both be odd. Thus p=2 or q=2. There are rarer primes of the form 2^2 + q^10 such as 2^2 + 3^10 = 59053 and 2^2 + 5^10 = 9765629 and 2^2 + 13^10 = 137858491853. Hence most solutions are of the form 2^10 + q^2 and (except for rarer solutions such as 5^2 + 2^10 = 1049 and 2^2 + 5^10 = 9765629, no more with the larger prime under 100) are congruent to 3 mod 10."
