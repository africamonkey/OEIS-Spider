        "This list is an incomplete run of the Script pplus2ton(1000,20000,8) which has been running for 2 days. These numbers are \"provable\" defiant primes (PVDP). Except for 47 and 79, the primes in this list are of the form 7m-1. So p + 8^k = 7m-1 + (7+1)^k. Expanding this, we get 7m-1 + 7H+1 == 0 mod(7) for some H.",

I call 271 a \"probable\" defiant prime (PDP). In fact, fewer iterations quickly produce provable defiant primes many of which are of the form 7m-1. k <= 1000 produces 113 as a probable defiant prime (PDP) but further checking shows 113 + 8^2265 is a PRP eliminating 113 from the table. Maybe someone can come up with general method to prove a PDP candidate is PVDP prime or not."
