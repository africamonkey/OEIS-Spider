        "Except for the first 2 terms, these numbers all end in 9. Proof: Any odd prime p>5 can have one of the following forms: 10k+1, 10k+3, 10k+7, 10k+9.",
        "10k+1 => p(p+2)+2 ends in 5, hence not prime, so p <> form 10k+1.",
        "10k+3 => (p+2) ends in 5, hence not prime, so p <> form 10k+3.",
        "10k+7 => p(p+2)+2 ends in 5, hence not prime, so p <> form 10k+7.",
        "Thus p is of the form 10k+9 as stated. Moreover, p+2 ends in 1 and p(p+2)+2 is of the form 100h+1 since (10k+9)(10k+11)+2 = 100(k^2+2k+1)+1.",
