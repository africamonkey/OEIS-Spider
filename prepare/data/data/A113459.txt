        "I disagree with that conjecture! Ignoring the initial terms, this will agree with A007918 up to some point and then (presumably) drop below A007918. The initial term in the arithmetic progression (of length n) must be >= n, but it is likely to be less than A007918(n) if n is large. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 18 2007"
