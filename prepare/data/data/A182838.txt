        "A H-toothpick sequence is a toothpick sequence on a square grid so that the toothpick structure resembles a honeycomb unfinished.",
        "Using a square grid is simulated to be on a hexagonal net.",
        "The structure has two types of elements: the classic toothpick with length 1 and the \"D-toothpick\"  with length 2^(1/2)=sqrt(2).",
        "Toothpicks are placed in the vertical direction and D-toothpicks are placed in diagonal direction.",
        "Each hexagon has area = 4.",
        "The network looks like an elongated hexagonal lattice placed on the square grid so that all nodes of the hexagonal net coincide with some of the grid points of the square grid. Each node in the hexagonal network is represented with coordinates x,y.",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks after n steps. A182839 (first difference) gives the number added at the n-th stage."
