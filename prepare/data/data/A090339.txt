        "a(n) counts the topologically distinct planar configurations of n unbounded curves such that each curve crosses each other curve at exactly one point and no two intersection points coincide.",
        "For n<8, a(n) is identical to A090338(n), where the curves must be straight line segments. But at n=8, we find a(n) includes three configurations that cannot be drawn with straight line segments. The qualification \"unbounded\" disallows configurations that have an endpoint within an area enclosed by other curves. As in A090338(n), configurations related by mirror symmetry are not counted as distinct."
