        "This sequence arises if you factor the product of a large number of the first odd numbers into the form 3^n(3)5^n(5)7^n(7)11^n(11)... Then n(3)/n(5) = 2, n(3)/n(7) = 3, n(3)/n(11) = 5, ... . - Andrzej Staruszkiewicz (astar(AT)th.if.uj.edu.pl), May 31 2007",
        "Kohen shows: A king invites n couples to sit around a round table with 2n+1 seats. For each couple, the king decides a prescribed distance d between 1 and n which the two spouses have to be seated from each other (distance d means that they are separated by exactly d-1 chairs). We will show that there is a solution for every choice of the distances if and only if 2n+1 is a prime number [i.e., iff n is in A005097], using a theorem known as Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jun 14 2010",
        "Starting from 6, positions at which new primes are seen for Goldbach partitions. E.g., 31 is first seen at 34 from 31+3, so position = 1 + (34-6)/2 = 15. - _Bill McEachen_, Jul 05 2010",

(This is equivalent to Goldbach's conjecture: every even integer greater than or equal to 6 can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes.) - _Lear Young_, May 20 2014",
        "See conjecture and comments from Richard R. Forberg, in Links section below, on the relationship of this sequence to rules on values of c that allow both p^q+c and p^q-c to be prime, for an infinite number of primes p. - _Richard R. Forberg_, Jul 13 2016",
        "The sequence represents the minimum number Ng of gears which are needed to draw a complete graph of order p using a Spirograph\u00ae, where p is an odd prime. The resulting graph consists of Ng hypotrochoids whose respective nodes coincide. If the teethed ring has a circumference p then Ng = (p-1)/2. Examples: A complete graph of order three can be drawn with a Spirograph\u00ae using a ring with 3n teeth and one gear with n teeth. n is an arbitrary number, only related to the geometry of the gears. A complete graph of order 5 can be drawn using a ring with diameter 5 and 2 gears with diameters 1 and 2 respectively. A complete graph of order 7 can be drawn using a ring with diameter 7 and 3 gears with diameters 1, 2 and 3 respectively. - _Bob Andriesse_, Mar 31 2017"
