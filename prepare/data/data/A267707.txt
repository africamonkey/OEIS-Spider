        "It is the sequence of triangular numbers (A000217) with progressive gaps that grow as 0,1,2,3, ... (consecutive numbers), by which I mean that the 0,1,2,3, ... consecutive triangular numbers are removed from A000217 to form this sequence. For instance, (1), 6, a triangular number, is missing between 3 and 10, which is the gap with 1 triangular number removed, (2), 15 and 21 (two consecutive triangular numbers) are missing between 10 and 28, which is the gap with 2 triangular numbers removed, and so on.",
        "The differences between the consecutive terms of this sequence can be expressed through the sum of cubes of two numbers separated by 2 as (n^3+(n+2)^3)/4, which is the same as A229183, except for the first term in there.",
        "The same pattern when applied to squares, A000290(A000290(n)+1), gives A082044(n). Triangular numbers are also linked in a similar manner to A027927(n) = A000217(A000217(n)+2)/3."
