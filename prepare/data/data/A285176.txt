        "15, 18 and 45 are the only elastic numbers with no 0 as a digit. Proof: let n = 10*m+k, 0<k<10. Then n is elastic only if 90*m is a multiple of n, i.e., 90*m = n*q = (10*m+k)*q = 10*m*q + k*q. It follows that q<9, so k*q<100. But k*q = 10*m*(9-q) which is no less than 100 if n has at least 3 digits. Contradiction. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Apr 18 2017"
