        "The only n, for which also 19*3494+23 is prime, is n=5600384. In principle, n == 4 (mod 10) can give primes of the form prime(k)*n+prime{k+1), for all k from 1 up to 41, while prime(42)*4+prime(43)=181*4+191 == 5 (mod 10) that is nonprime. It'd be very interesting to find at least one n such that prime[k]*n+prime[k+1), k=1,...,41 are all prime."
