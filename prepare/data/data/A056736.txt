    "comment": [
        "Using empirical data for 1 <= n <= 10000, it has been found that the distribution of these terms correlates well (R^2 = 0.9936) to h(n) = c*n^(1/2) with 'c' a constant approximately 0.64. In addition, h'(n) approximates the probability that any particular n has this property. Any terms in sequence A056154 must also satisfy this sequence."
