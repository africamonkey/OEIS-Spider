        "See Table on p. 11 of Bras-Amor\u00f3s. From the abstract of that paper: \"A numerical semigroup is said to be ordinary if it has all its gaps in a row. Indeed, it contains zero and all integers from a given positive one. One can define a simple operation on a non-ordinary semigroup, which we call here the ordinarization transform, by removing its smallest nonzero non-gap (the multiplicity) and adding its largest gap (the Frobenius number). This gives another numerical semigroup and by repeating this transform several times we end up with an ordinary semigroup. The genus, that is, the number of gaps, is kept constant in all the transforms.\""
