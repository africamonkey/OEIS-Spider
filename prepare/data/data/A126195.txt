    "comment": [
        "A solid sphere of unit radius in touch with and outside a sphere of radius n occupies a projected angle of theta=2*arcsin[1/(1+n)]. (In the projection, the large sphere center, the small sphere center and the point where the tangent from the large sphere center touches the small sphere form a rectilinear triangle with hypotenuse of length 1+n and one cathetus of length 1. One of the angles in the triangle is theta/2.) Values have been obtained by reverse interpolation of these angles theta(n=1,2,3,...)=60, 38.9, 28.95,... degrees etc. from the \"min separation\" column of the Sloane table to the \"npts\" column, rounding npts down."
