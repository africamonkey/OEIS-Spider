        "For primes p, q, r the sum p^4 + q^4 + r^4 can be prime only if at least one of p, q, r equals 3. This sequence is the special case q = 5, r = 3.",
        "It is conjectured that the sequence is infinite.",
        "There are twin prime (101, 103) and other consecutive primes (151, 157; 1867, 1871) in the sequence."

    "example": [
        "p = 3: 3^4 + 5^4 + 3^4 = 787 is prime, so 3 is in the sequence.",
        "p = 5: 5^4 + 5^4 + 3^4 = 1331 = 11^3, so 5 is not in the sequence.",
        "p = 101: 101^4 + 5^4 + 3^4 = 104061107 is prime, so 101 is in the sequence.",
        "p = 103: 103^4 + 5^4 + 3^4 = 112551587 is prime, so 103 is in the sequence."
