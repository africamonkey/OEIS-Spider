        "Some pattern is visible which would change when three or more digit numbers occur in A082249. Conjecture: If the concatenation of k, consecutive r-digit numbers is divisible by n then the concatenation of the next k numbers would also be divisible by n provided it contains the same number of digits as the first number. This should be true for both forward as well as reverse concatenation."
