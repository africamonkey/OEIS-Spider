        "Let T* be the infinite tree with root 0 generated by these rules:  if p is in T*, then p+1 is in T* and x*p is in T*.  Let g(n) be the set of nodes in the n-th generation, so that g(0) = {0}, g(1) = {1}, g(2) = {2,x}, g(3) = {3,2x,x+1,x^2}, etc.  Let T(r) be the tree obtained by substituting r for x.",
        "For each integer k > 0, let s(k,n) be the number of integers in the n-th generation of T(k*i).  Conjecture:  there is a limiting sequence S(n) as k increases, and S(n) = F(n) for n >= 1, where F = A000045 (Fibonacci numbers).",
