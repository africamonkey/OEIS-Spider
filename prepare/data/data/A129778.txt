    "comment": [
        "The Deodhar elements are a subset of the fully commutative elements. If w is Deodhar, there are simple explicit formulas for all the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials P_{x,w} and the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis element C'_w is the product of C'_{s_i}'s corresponding to any reduced expression for w."

    "example": [
        "a(4)=48 because there are 48 fully commutative elements in D_4 and since the first non-Deodhar fully-commutative element does not appear until D_6, these are all of the Deodhar elements in D_4."
