        "It is obvious that the terms occur in increasing order, since the mean increases by (prime(n)-prime(n-10))/10 when going to the 10 primes which include prime(n) as largest term. However, differences of 6, as e.g. between the terms a(n)=9813497 and a(n+1)=9813503 (= average of prime(653096) through prime(653105)), seem to occur infinitely often. Is this true, and is this the smallest such step? - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 21 2012",
