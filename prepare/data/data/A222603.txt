        "By a result of Melfi, each positive even number can be written as the sum of two practical numbers.",
        "For a practical number p, define h(p) as the least practical number q>p such that 2(p+1)-q is practical. Construct a simple (undirected) graph H as follows: The vertex set of H is the set of all practical numbers, and for two vertices p and q>p there is an edge connecting p and q if and only if h(p)=q. Clearly H contains no cycle.",
        "Conjecture: The graph H constructed above is connected and hence it is a tree."
