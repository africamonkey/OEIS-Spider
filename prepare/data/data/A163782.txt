        "Place the numbers 1..N (N>=2) on a circle and cyclicly mark the 2nd unmarked number until all N numbers are marked. The order in which the N numbers are marked defines a permutation; N is a J_2-prime if this permutation consists of a single cycle of length N.",
        "No formula is known for a(n): the J_2-primes have been found by exhaustive search (however, see the CROSS-REFERENCES). But we have: (1) N is J_2-prime iff p=2N+1 is a prime number and +2 generates Z_p^* (the multiplicative group of Z_p). (2) N is J_2-prime iff p=2N+1 is a prime number and exactly one of the following holds: (a) N=1 (mod 4) and +2 generates Z_p^* but -2 does not, (b) N=2 (mod 4) and both +2 and -2 generate Z_p^*."
