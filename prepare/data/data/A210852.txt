        "The numbers are computed from the recurrence given below in the formula field. This recurrence follows from the formula a(n) = 3^(7^(n-1)) (mod 7^n), n>= 1, which satisfies a(n)^3  + 1 == 0 (mod 7^n), n>=1. a(0) = 0 satisfies this congruence as well. The proof can be done by showing that each term in the binomial expansion of (3^(7^(n-1)))^3 +1 = (28 -1)^(7^(n-1)) + 1  has a factor 7^n.",
