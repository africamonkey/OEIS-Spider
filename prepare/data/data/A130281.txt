        "If n>4 is an even square, n=4k^2, then A130280(n) <= k since n(k^2-1)+1 = (2k^2-1)^2. This sequence lists those k for which we have strict inequality. Most terms in this sequence belong to the subsequence b(m)=2m*(2m^2-1), m>1, for which A130280(4 b(m)^2) <= m < b(m), since 4 b(m)^2(m^2-1)+1 = (8m^4-8m^2+1)^2. For other terms k of this sequence (e.g., the subsequence 390, 3465, 15372, 48015, ...), A130280(4k^2) is even smaller."
