        "The Gordon Lee puzzle asks for an n X n array of single digits such that as many distinct primes as possible are formed by joining consecutive digits in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction, forward or backward. a(4)=63 was proved in March 2005 by Mike Oakes. a(5) and a(6) are conjectured best values that resisted any improvement since 1998.",
        "a(5), a(6) and a(7) are conjectured best values that have resisted any improvement since 1998, including the joint effort of more than 100 participants in a programming contest in summer 2005. The best currently (September 2005) known lower bounds for the next terms are a(8)>=394 and a(9)>=527. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Sep 21 2005"
