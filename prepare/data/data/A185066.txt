        "Bershadskii: Let us take, as a first step, logarithms of the gaps for the sequence of prime numbers.... Then, let us compute cumulative sum of these logarithms as a second step. Then, we will multiply each value in the cumulative sum by 10 and will replace each of the obtained values by a natural number which is nearest to it."
