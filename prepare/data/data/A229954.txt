    "comment": [
        "Consider an alphabet with n letters, say {a_0, a_1, ... a_{n-1} }. For two words v and w over this alphabet, we say v embeds in w, or v is a subsequence of w, if v can be obtained from w by erasing some (occurrences of) letters.",
        "Define two words to be 2-equivalent if they have the same subsequences of length up to 2. The n-th term of this sequence is the number of equivalence classes of this equivalence relation, when the size of the alphabet is n."
