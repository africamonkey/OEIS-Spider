        "Let A = set of numbers of form 6n + 1, B = numbers of form 6n - 1. Eliminating numbers of form 25 + 30s from A and those of form 35 + 30s from B we obtain sets A* and B*. Removing all terms of the sequence from the union of A* and B*, only prime numbers remain. - Hisanobu Shinya (ilikemathematics(AT)hotmail.com), Jul 14 2002",
