        "The sequence is related to the Rassias Conjecture (\"for any prime p there are two primes p1 and p2 such that p*p1=p1+p2+1, p>2, p2>p1\", see A190272-A190275), because n = p1*p2, m=p1*p -> p1*p = p1+p2-1. The sequence includes the cases with p=p1 (or p2). Generalization can be achieved by removing semiprimarity condition or accepting gcd(n,m)=1. The differential equation in its general form n'=m+1 includes Giuga Numbers, i.e., n'=b*n+1, or n'=n+1 (A007850)."
