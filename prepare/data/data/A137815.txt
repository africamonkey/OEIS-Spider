        "Following D. Iannucci, n is called a \"year number\" if phi(n) / phi(sigma(n)) = 2 (thus 365 is a year number, explaining the terminology).",
        "D. Iannucci asks: Are there any even year numbers? Are there any odd year numbers that are not squarefree?",
        "Remark: If n = q_1 q_2 ... q_k is a product of odd primes such that (q_j + 1)/2 is an odd prime for all j, then n is a year number.",
        "Solution: for nonsquarefree year numbers, see A137816. See A137817-A137819 for year numbers with cubes, 4th powers, 5th powers.",
        "Eric Landquist found year numbers divisible by 7^2, 7^3 and 7^4, as well as 120781449 = 3^8 * 41 * 449.",
        "The existence of even year numbers is still open, but Eric checked all 200-smooth even integers with a single large prime up to 10^8 and found no year numbers among them.",
        "See also references in A082897 (perfect totient numbers)."
