        "The Fermat-Catalan conjecture states that there are only finitely many terms. For the values of the six parameters x, y, z, p, q and r corresponding to the ten known terms, see the Weisstein article on this conjecture under Links. For each of the ten known terms, at least one of the exponents p, q and r is 2. A closely-related conjecture, the Tijdeman-Zagier conjecture (known more popularly as Beal's conjecture) is that there exists no set of three positive coprime integers x, y, z such that x^p + y^q = z^r where p, q, r are all integers greater than 2. The Beal problem, for which there is a $1,000,000 prize, is to find such a solution or to show that no such solution exists. See Mauldin (1997). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 22 2013 [Edited by _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Oct 03 2015]",

        "In the Fermat-Calatan conjecture and Beal's conjecture, it must be required that the x, y, z are coprime. Otherwise, these conjectures would fail. For example, 2^n + 2^n = 2^(n+1). Moreover, for any integers a, b and n, z = a^n + b^n, x = az and y = bz, the equality x^n + y^n = z^(n+1) holds. There exist other \"counterexamples\" such as (3^3)^n + (2 * 3^n)^3 = 3^(3n+2) (derived from 1 + 2^3 = 3^2).",
        "Finiteness of this sequence would follow from the abc-conjecture.",
        "For each fixed A, B, C, p, q and r with 1/p + 1/q + 1/r < 1, the equation Ax^p + By^q = Cz^r has only finitely many coprime integer solutions x, y and z (H. Darmon, A. Grandville). (End)"
