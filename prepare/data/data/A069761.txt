        "The Frobenius number of a numerical semigroup generated by relatively prime integers a_1,...,a_n is the largest positive integer that is not a nonnegative linear combination of a_1,...,a_n. Since four consecutive tetrahedral numbers are relatively prime, they generate a numerical semigroup with a Frobenius number."
