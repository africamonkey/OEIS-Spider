        "We include \"1\" for the 1-dimensional trivial representation and we list each dimension once, ignoring the possibility that inequivalent representations may have the same dimension."

        "The highest weight 000000 corresponds to the 1-dimensional module on which E6 acts trivially. The smallest faithful representations of E6 have dimension 27, highest weight 000001 or 100000 and are minuscule. The adjoint representation of dimension 78 (the third term in the sequence) has highest weight 010000."
