        "\"Squarefree\" integers. The usual definition of \"squarefree\" means that there is no square as divisor, but here we consider numbers without any square in their decimal expansion. Of the first 1000 integers only 232 are in the sequence, while 608 are squarefree in the usual sense. - _Zak Seidov_, Sep 26 2002",
        "Sequence is infinite, since numbers consisting of only the digits 2, 3, 7, and 8 cannot contain squares. In particular this shows a(n) << n^1.661. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 05 2014"
