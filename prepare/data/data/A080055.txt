        "The n-th greedy power of x, when 0.5 < x < 1, is the smallest integer exponent a(n) that does not cause the power series sum_{k=1..n} x^a(k) to exceed unity. A heuristic argument suggests that the limit of a(n)/n is m - sum_{n>=m} log(1 + x^n)/log(x) = 5.7114827587..., where x = log(2) and m = floor(log(1-x)/log(x))=3."
