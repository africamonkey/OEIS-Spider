        "MacKinnon only allows polyominoes with >= n cells, leading to A125709 and A125753.",
        "The polyominoes with < 2n cells are uninteresting, leading to A126742 and A126743.",
        "There is a sense in which n-decomposable polyominoes with >3n-2 cells are also uninteresting: they are precisely the \"n-spiders\", where an n-spider is a polyomino with a cell whose removal splits it into 4 components each with <n cells. - Peter Pleasants, Feb 18 2007"
