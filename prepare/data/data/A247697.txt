    "name": "Minimal absolute discriminants a(n) of complex quadratic fields with 3-class group of type (3,3), 3-principalization type G.16 (2134), second 3-class group G of even nilpotency class cl(G)=2(n+3), and 3-class tower of unknown length at least 3.",
    "comment": [
        "The 3-principalization type (transfer kernel type, TKT) G.16 (2134) is a permutation, contains a transposition, and has two fixed points.",
        "The nilpotency condition cl(G)=2n+6 for the second 3-class group is equivalent to a transfer target type, TTT (called IPAD by Boston, Bush and Hajir) of the shape [(3,9),(3^{n+2},3^{n+3}),(3,9)^2].",
        "The second 3-class group G is one of two vertices of depth 2 on the coclass tree with root SmallGroup(243,8) contained in the coclass graph G(3,2).",
        "The length of the Hilbert 3-class field tower of all these fields is completely unknown. Therefore, these discriminants are among the foremost challenges of future research, similarly as those of A242873, A247688, A247694.",
        "A247697 is an extremely sparse subsequence of A242878 and it is exceedingly hard to compute a(n) for n>0."
