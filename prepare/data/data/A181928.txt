        "The first six primitives triangles (with areas {1680, 221760, 8168160, 95726400, 302793120, 569336866560}) have been discovered by Ralph H. Buchholz and are listed in a table of the chapter 4 of his thesis (see Links).",
        "Later on, Buchholz & Rathbun identified an infinite family of Heronian triangles with 2 integer medians (comprising 4 of the 6 triangles above). The next two primitive triangles in such family have areas 8548588738240320 and 17293367819066194215360. - _Giovanni Resta_, Apr 05 2017",
        "The areas of non-primitive triangles are of the form {1680*k^2}, {221760*k^2}, {8168160*k^2}, {95726400*k^2}, {302793120*k^2}, ...",
        "Using Heron's formula for the area A of a triangle with sides (a, b, c), the existence of a triangle with three rational medians and integer (or rational) area implies a solution of the Diophantine system:",
        "4x^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2 - c^2",
        "4y^2 = 2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2",

        "where s = (a+b+c)/2 is the semiperimeter and x, y, z the medians.",
        "There is no solution known to this system at this time. The problem is similar to the more famous unsolved problem of finding a box with edges, faces diagonals and body diagonals all rational. Such a box also involves seven quantities which must satisfy a system of four Diophantine equations:",

        "It seems that, for any n, a(n) == 0 (mod 1680). The reverse is not always true: e.g., as mentioned by _Giovanni Resta_, the triangle with sides (56*k, 61*k, 75*k) has area of the form 1680 * k^2, but it cannot be a term of a(n). - _Sergey Pavlov_, Mar 31 2017"
