        "Conjecture:  For any odd prime p there is at most one odd prime q, with q<p, for which p*q-1 is square.",
        "(Note: If p was not restricted to being prime, there could be multiple primes q which make p*q-1 a square, with increasing multiplicities for larger p.  The upper limit on the multiplicity of solutions, for prime and nonprime p and q values, are given by A006278. Note, however that those limits allow for solutions where q=2, and therefore two solutions when p and q are prime).",
        "a(n) is a subsequence of the Pythagorean Primes (A002144), which are of the form 4k+1.",
        "The density of a(n) values among the primes declines with increasing n. For example a(n) is about 22% of the first 1000 primes, and  drops to about 15% of \"incremental\" primes around prime(10000). The density continues to fall among even larger primes. Twice those percentages apply as a portion of A002144.",
        "All values of q also belong to A002144. It appears the set of q values \"intends to\" fully comprise A002144.  This is notable because p values comprise an increasingly sparse subsequence within A002144, and each p value has just one q value.",
        "The ability to fully comprise A002144 with q values is further challenged by the fact that the for any given q value (i.e., any element of A002144) multiple values of p > q can be found such that p*q-1 is square. Thus q values are \"promiscuous\", and apparently without bounds on the number of p values they can serve.",
        "Contrast this with primes p and q such that p*q+1 is square.  The result are the Twin Primes (A001359 and A006512), arranged in a simple one-to-one correspondence, with p = q+2."
