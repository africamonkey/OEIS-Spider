        "This sequence is a subsequence of A140057, A078348, and A108571. There are 129 terms; the largest is 7777777666666444455555223331. As 1, 122, and 221 are not prime and any such numbers whose maximum digit is 4, 8, or 9 are divisible by 3, all terms of the sequence have either 6 (1 term), 15 (8 terms), 21 (24 terms), or 28 (96 terms) decimal digits (=triangular numbers A000217(n) for n=3,5,6,7, respectively).",
