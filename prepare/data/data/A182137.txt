        "In the Collatz Problem A014682, it is possible to apply the algorithm to first degree polynomials like 2^n*x+b, where n is integer and 0 <= b < 2^n. The iteration terminates by two cases:",

        "2) a*x+b where a is odd and a > 2^n, parity cannot be found. The polynomial cannot be minimized.",
        "The sequence counts how many first degree polynomials end like first case for each n > 0.",
        "The interest of this sequence is that every number that can be described by a minimized polynomial cannot be the smallest element of a set of value of T(n) = infinity."
