        "This sequence is part of the two dimensional array of sequences based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.",
