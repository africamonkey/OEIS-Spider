        "This is the range of the norm a^2 + b^2 of Gaussian primes a + b i. A239361 lists for each norm value a(n) one of the Gaussian primes as a, b with a >= b >= 0. In A239397 a >= 0 and b >= 0, beginning with 1, 1 for a(1)= 2, and then a(n) appears for a, b as well as for the following b, a, with a > b. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Mar 24 2014",

        "The present sequence is related to the square lattice, and to its division in square sublattices. Let's say that an integer n divides a lattice if there exists a sublattice of index n. Example: 2, 4, 5 divide the square lattice. Then A001481 (norms of Gaussian integers) is the sequence of divisors of the square lattice. Say that n is a \"prime divisor\" if the index-n sublattice is not contained in any other sublattice except the original lattice itself. The present sequence gives the \"prime divisors\" of the square lattice.",
        "Similarly, A055664 (Norms of Eisenstein-Jacobi primes) is the sequence of \"prime divisors\" of the hexagonal lattice. (End)",
        "The sequence is formed of 2, the prime numbers of form 4k+1, and the square of other primes (of form 4k+3). These are the primitive elements of A001481. With 0 and 1, they are the numbers that are uniquely decomposable in the sum of two squares. - _Jean-Christophe Herv\u00e9_, Nov 17 2013"
