        "Conjecture: for these and only these n, the absolute value of the numerator of Bernoulli(n) is congruent 5 modulo 6. If this is true, then you can obtain the residue modulo 6 of the absolute value of Bernoulli numerators by calculating their denominators/6 modulo 30. The program uses the von Staudt-Clausen Theorem.  None of these n are in the complementary sequence, A233578 (n >= 2 such that the denominator/6 of Bernoulli_n is congruent to {1, 5, 7, 13 or 19} modulo 30).  I have checked and verified that, up to n = 50446, the union of A233578 and A233579 is all even numbers >= 2."
