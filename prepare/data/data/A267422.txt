        "Note that the prime factors of the largest squarefree practical number with n prime factors are the first n members of a(n). The largest squarefree practical number with 3 prime factors is 78 = 2*3*13 and the largest squarefree practical number with 5 prime factors is 367580694 = 2*3*13*167*28219, etc."

    "example": [
        "a(3) = 13 because there are only 4 squarefree practical numbers with 3 prime factors, namely 2*3*5 = 30, 2*3*7 = 42, 2*3*11 = 66 and 2*3*13 = 78. So 78 is the largest squarefree practical number with 3 prime factors and the largest prime factor is 13."
