    "comment": [
        "Any nonnegative integer can be written as a sum of distinct members of A075058 because it is a complete sequence. a(n) is the smallest integer that is the sum of n distinct members of A075058 in the same way that A066352 gives a Pillai sequence for the complete sequence comprising 1 followed by all the primes."
