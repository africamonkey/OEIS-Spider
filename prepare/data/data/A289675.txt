        "Post's tag system maps a word w over {1,2} to w', where if w begins with 1, w' is obtained by appending 11 to w and deleting the first three letters, or if w begins with 2, w' is obtained by appending 2212 to w and deleting the first three letters.",
        "Under this Post tag system, some words when iterated end at the empty word, others go into cycles, and others may have an orbit which grows without limit. See A289670 and A289671 for the counts of the first two types. This sequence gives a list of the words that end at the empty word.",
        "We work over {1,2} rather than the official alphabet {0,1} because of the prohibition in the OEIS of terms (other than 0 itself) which begin with 0.",
        "Stillwell (2016, page 100) remarks that Post was unable to find an algorithm to determine which words belong to this sequence, \"and in fact this particular `halting problem' remains unsolved to this day\"."
