Primes are either divisors or primes to n. Thus a term here should be a composite odd number from A071904, whose first entry is 9; so next candidates are 15, 21, 25, 27...

        "Answer: no.  Proof: Suppose A073758(n) = k is odd and not a prime power.  Let k = g*u where g = gcd(n,k) > 1.  Since k does not divide n, u > 1.  Since 2*g < k is not unrelated to n, it must divide n, so n is even.  Let p be a prime factor of u.  Since 2*p is not unrelated to n, p must divide n.  But then p^d < k is unrelated to n, where p^d is the highest power of p dividing k. - _Robert Israel_, Sep 11 2014"
