        "The a(n) represent the number of n-move routes of a fairy chess piece starting in the central square (m = 5) on a 3 X 3 chessboard. This fairy chess piece behaves like a king on the eight side and corner squares but on the central square the king toes crazy and turns into a red king, see A179596.",
        "The sequence above corresponds to 4 red king vectors, A[5] vectors, with decimal [binary] values 327 [1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1], 333 [1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1], 357 [1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1] and 453 [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1]. These vectors lead for the corner squares to A179604 and for the side squares to A015448."
