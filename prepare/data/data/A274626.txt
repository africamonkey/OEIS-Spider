        "where i runs from 0 (for the last dimension to be folded) through d-1 (for the first dimension to be folded).",
        "The corresponding number of internal dividing lines/planes/etc. is (2^floor((n+i)/d)-1).  The number of internal d-way intersections, which corresponds to the number of holes, is:",
        "    Product_{i=0..d-1}(2^floor((n+i)/d)-1)",
        "where d is the number of dimensions and n is the total number of folds.",
        "Note that the first several nonzero entries in these sequences are the powers of 3. Specifically, in d dimensions, the first d entries are 0, followed by the first (d+1) powers of 3.",
        "It's not hard to see why this is so. The first nonzero entry occurs at d folds, and the value is 1.  This is when you've folded once along each dimension.",
        "After that, the next d folds each divide 2 old partitions into 4 new ones, i.e., they change the internal folds from 1 to 3. So for the next d entries you just multiply the previous entry by 3 (or more generally, by 3/1).",
        "After that you multiply by 7/3 for the next d entries, then 15/7, then 31/15, etc. Each time you're just replacing one of the old factors with a new one, where each factor is one less than a power of two.",
        "Here's an alternative formulation that avoids the iterated product.",
