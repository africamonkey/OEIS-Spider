        "Here H(k) is the k-th harmonic number, sum_{i=1..k) 1/i, and sigma(k) is the sum of the divisors of k. This function is derived from an inequality in Lagarias' paper. The condition f(k) > 0 for all k > 1 is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis (RH). Every colossally abundant number (A004490) is here. Every superabundant number (A004394) greater than 665280 appears to be here also. This sequence is meaningless if the RH is false."
