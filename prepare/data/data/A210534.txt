        "Analogous to A210511, except that the second n is digit reversed. If the first (leftmost) n were reversed, we would have problems with trailing zeros becoming leading zeros, which get removed in OEIS formatting. That is a slightly different sequence is given by the formula primes of the form n concatenated with A004086(n) concatenated with \"1\"; or Primes of form a(n) = (n*10^A055642(n)+A004086(n)) concatenated with \"1\"."
