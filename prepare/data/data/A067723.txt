        "There are no terms with an even number of digits. Proof: If m is in the sequence then phi(m) and m are palindrome since phi(m) is palindrome so 10=phi(11) doesn't divide phi(m) hence 11 doesn't divide m but we know that 11 divides every palindromic number with an even number of digits so m can't be with an even number of digits. - Farideh Firoozbakht, Feb 03 2006"
