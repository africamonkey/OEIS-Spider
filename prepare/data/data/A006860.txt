        "WARNING: The currently listed value of a(8) is inconsistent with the result from Kreweras and Klarner quoted below, as pointed out by _Michel Marcus_. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 03 2012",
        "A corrected version of this sequence is A223911. - _Joerg Arndt_, Mar 29 2013",
        "Graded posets, i.e., those in which every maximal chain has the same length. (The terminology \"graded\" is also used to refer to a weaker notion; see A001833.)",
        "Kreweras observed and Klarner proved that a(n) is congruent to 1 (resp. 3) modulo 6 when n is odd (resp. even). - _Michel Marcus_, Nov 03 2012",
        "Using the formulas in the paper from Klarner (cf. PARI code), I get 1, 3, 13, 85, 801, 10231, 168253, 3437673, 85162465, 2511412651, 86805640461, 3469622549053, ... - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 07 2012",
        "The values currently in the sequence through 25623 are certainly correct (I've enumerated these posets by brute force and other methods). (...) Klarner's eq.(2) contains a typo: instead of f(m_1, m_h) it should be f(m_1, m_2).  (The point here is that the Hasse diagram of each of these posets decomposes as a bunch of bipartite graphs layered on top of each other; there are f(m_1, m_2) ways to choose the bipartite graph between the first two ranks of vertices, then f(m_2, m_3) ways to choose the bipartite graph between the second and third ranks of vertices, etc.)  (...).  When I implement Klarner's eqs.(1) and (2) (corrected) I get the following sequence: 1, 3, 13, 111, 1381, 25623, 678133, 26169951, 1447456261, 114973232583, ... Now we get the right terms up as far as I personally have experience (...) and they agree with Kreweras (and the current OEIS sequence) until a(8), at which point there is disagreement.
