        "Inspired by Van der Waerden's Theorem, the positive integers are partitioned into two disjoint sequences, A and B, so that they obey the following rules:",
        "Rule 1: For a given n, let A(n) and B(n) be the subsets of A and B with terms less than or equal to n. Any maximal arithmetic subsequence of A(n) must have at least as many terms as any maximal arithmetic subsequence of B(n).",
        "Rule 2: Construct the sequences by starting at 1 and always favoring to add terms to B, unless it violates Rule 1. Add terms to A if they cannot be added to B.",
        "The sequence listed here is the A sequence."

        "A gets 1, because B cannot yet have an AS of length 1.",
