Coincides for the first 58 terms with A212375, that is the sequence of primes p such that x^18 = 2 has no solution mod p (first divergence is at 433, cf. A059664). Also coincides for the first 58 terms with sequence of primes p such that x^54 = 2 has no solution mod p (first divergence is at 433, cf. A059665). The sequence for x^18 and the sequence for x^54 coincide for the first 379 terms (first divergence is at 3943, cf. A059666). - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Feb 04 2001"
