    "comment": [
        "We start with a string, of length n, that is the identity permutation of alphabet letters. The space between two adjacent letters is called a breakpoint. We then apply duplications, which take a substring and inserts it into another part of the string. Each duplication uses three breakpoints; two for the substring and one for its destination. The destination cannot be within the substring to be duplicated. Each breakpoint can only be used once. These duplications produce a word T. The formula for the longest possible T uses the length of each string (n) and the most duplications that can occur (k)."
