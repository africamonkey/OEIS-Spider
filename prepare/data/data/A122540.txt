        "If you replace 'prime' with 'odd number', the sequence is 17, 2673, 16196193, 155129315313, ... Next term is at least 3000^4.",
        "The restriction to primes is quite severe and to odd numbers reasonably so; otherwise x^4+y^4+(x+y)^4=2(x^2+xy+y^2)^2 gives very many examples of the form 2k^2."
