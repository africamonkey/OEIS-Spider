        "Conjecture: the limit of a(n)/10^n tends to 3/Pi^2 (A104141). This is based on the assumption, conditional on the Birch Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, that all squarefree integers congruent to {5, 6, 7} mod 8 (A273929) are a subset of primitive congruent numbers (A006991) and have a natural density of 3/Pi^2. However, squarefree integers congruent to {1, 2, 3} mod 8 are conjecturally sparsely congruent numbers with a natural density of 0. It has been proved without the BSD conjecture that the natural density of congruent numbers is at least 55.9% the natural density of squarefree numbers congruent to {5, 6, 7} mod 8 (see A. Smith link).",
        "The mathematica program below is a slow implementation of the Tunnell criteria for determining congruent numbers. It will give counts for up to 10^5 in realistic time. Counts for 10^6 and 10^7 have been derived from tables generated by _Giovanni Resta_ (see link)."
