        "If these partitions are \"flattened\" into a simple partition, the resulting partitions are those for which any part size present with multiplicity k implies the presence of at least k(k-1)/2 larger parts. E.g., [3,1|1] flattens to [3,1^2], 1 has multiplicity 2, so there must be at least 2*1/2 = 1 part larger than 1 - which is the 3."
