        "This is to numbers that are the sum of 2 different primes (A038609) as primorials (A002110) are to primes (A000040). The subsequence of primes among these sums of 2 distinct primorials is the sequence of primorial primes (A018239) which is the same as the subsequence of primes among the Euclid numbers (A006862)."
