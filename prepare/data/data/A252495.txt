    "comment": [
        "Inclusion of the single-digit terms is conventional: here the property is vacuously satisfied since no sum can be constructed by inserting a + sign between two digits, therefore all possible sums are prime. (It is not allowed to prefix a leading zero (e.g., to forbid 4 = 04 = 0+4) since in that case all terms must be prime and one would get A089392.)",
        "The restriction on leading zeros means that numbers with digit 0 other than in the last position are excluded, so this sequence equals A252996 with terms in A252480 removed.",
        "Since all primes > 2 are odd, all terms different from 11 and 20 have the last digit of opposite parity to that of all other digits.",
        "As A252996, this sequence is \"finite\" (without rigorous proof), and up to 5e16 the only terms with more than 11 digits are 5391391551358 and 97393713331910, the latter being probably the largest element of this sequence (due to _Giovanni Resta_).",
        "(See links for \"intellectual ownership\": The sequence (without single digit terms) was suggested by _Eric Angelini_, a first list of terms computed by _Lars Blomberg_, then others. _Hans Havermann_ observed that this is a variant of what had been termed \"magnanimous numbers\" at least 10 years ago by A. Murthy, G. Resta and/or C. Rivera, cf. A089392 and links.)"
