        "3*a(n) is conjectured to be the total number of sides (straight double bonds (long side) and single bond (short side)) of a certain equilateral triangle expansion shown in one of the links. The pattern is supposed to become the planar Archimedean net 3.3.3.3.6 when n -> infinity. 3*a(n) is also conjectured to be the total number of sided (bonds) in another version of an equilateral triangle expansion that is supposed to become the planar Archimedean net 3.6.3.6. See the illustrations in the links. - _Kival Ngaokrajang_, Nov 30 2014"
