    "comment": [
        "The U.S.A. issued the following unusual denomination coins during the 18th and 19th centuries: 1/2-cent pieces, 1793-1857; 2-cent pieces, 1864-1873; 3-cent pieces, 1851-1889; and 20-cent pieces, 1875-1878. This sequence is also the number of ways of making change for n cents using coins of 1 (two types, say, old pre-1858 \"large cents\" and 1856-to-present \"small cents\"), 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 cents. For present purposes, one of the two types of 1-cent piece is actually taken to be two 1/2-cent pieces."
