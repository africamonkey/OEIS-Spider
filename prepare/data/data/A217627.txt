        "The formula a(10^k) = 46^k can be easily derived from the Multinomial Theorem, inspecting the expansion of (1+1+2+3+...+9)^k, where the second '1's takes the place of '0' (since we are neglecting the zeros in the products). This formula can be generalized as follows:",
        "Let B>1 be the base used for representation. Let D be a subset of {1,2,...,B-1}. Using base B, let A(n) be the sum of the products of the digits in D of the numbers up to n. Then, A(B^k)=(B+S-|D|)^k, where |D| is the cardinality of D and S is the sum of the elements of D. For example, in base 10, with D={1,3,5,7,9}, (i.e., A(n)= sum of the products of the odd digits of the numbers up to n) we have A(k)=(10+(1+3+5+7+9)-5)^k = 30^k."
