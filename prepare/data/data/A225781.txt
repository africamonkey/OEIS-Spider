        "It seems to be the case that all primes n where (n+1)/2 is also prime share the property that they are also both either evil or odious, the sole exception being 3, which is evil but has 2 as an odious companion.",
        "The last comment is true; for n and (n+1)/2 to be prime, n must be the number 3 or have the form 4*k + 1. The latter means its binary expansion ends in 01. Adding 1 to such a number and dividing by 2 leaves the bit count the same. Hence, both of these numbers have the same parity; they are both evil or both odius. - _Jon Perry_, May 25 2013"
