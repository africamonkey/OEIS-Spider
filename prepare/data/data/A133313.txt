        "Theorem: If in the triple (3n-2,n,3n+2) all numbers are primes, then n=5 or the decimal representation of n finishes with 3 or 7. Proof: Similar to A136191. Alternative Mathematica proof: Table[nn = 10k + r; Intersection (AT)(AT) (Divisors[CoefficientList[(3nn - 2) nn(3nn + 2), k]]), {r, 1, 9, 2}]; This gives {{1, 5}, {1}, {1, 5}, {1}, {1, 5}}. Therefore only r=3 and r=7 allow nontrivial divisors (excluding nn=5 itself)."
