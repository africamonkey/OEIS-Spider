        "Real primes 2,5,13,17,29,37,... have a unique representation as sum of two squares. Values larger 2 are the primes p with p = 1 mod 4. This is sequence A002313. If p = x^2 + y^2, the corresponding complex prime is x+y*i First complex prime is 1+i with 2 as corresponding real prime, according to reference, page 1-2."
