        "Note that by definition a(4)..a(10) = [2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 15, 24] is the number of compositions (ordered partitions) of [7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19] respectively, into primes of form x^2 + y^2. On the other hand a(4)..a(10) = [2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 15, 24] is also the number of laps related to the orbital resonances of the seven Earth-sized planets [h, g, f, e, d, c, b] in the planetary system of the TRAPPIST-1 star (see links). Observation: the least common multiple of this finite subset is 360. Lcm(2,3,4,6,9,15,24) = 2^3*3^2*5^1 = 8*9*5 = 360."
