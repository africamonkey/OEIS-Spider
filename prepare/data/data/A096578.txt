    "comment": [
        "Operation 'time lapse', or 'lapse', L, operates on a solid partition by creating a new one, layer by layer. Layer k is defined by its 3-dimensional-Ferrers plot, equal to the (existence of) elements of the solid partition with value >= k. As if taking a time-lapse picture of the solid partition, filtering out elements less than k and projecting the resulting structure (filled with ones) to the base plane. Given there are three plane to project into, together with the starting solid partition, that makezs four 'isomers'."
