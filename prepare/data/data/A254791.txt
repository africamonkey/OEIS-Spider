        "On the term \"nontrivial\":",
        "If a !=b, sigma(a) = sigma(b) and rad(a) = rad(b) then sigma(a*x) = sigma(b*x) and rad(n*x) = rad(m*x) when gcd(a, b) = gcd(a,x) = gcd(b,x) = 1. So each general solution to the stated problem could generate an infinitude of constructed, \"trivial\" solutions.  So we will limit ourselves to the more interesting \"nontrivial\" solutions.  Precisely, if rad(a) = rad(b) = prod(p(i)), we can write a= prod(p(i)^a(i)), b = prod(p(i)^b(i)) and In this context, a(i) != b(i) for each i in order to have a nontrivial solution.",
