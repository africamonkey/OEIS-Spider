        "Let the binary representation of n be thought of as a string of 0's and 1's. By a \"run\" of 0's or 1's, it is meant either a contiguous substring all of 0's bounded by 1's or the by the edge of the string, or a contiguous substring all of 1's bounded by 0's or the by the edge of the string.",

For example, 263 is in the sequence since its binary form is 100000111 and the composition [1,5,3] has only odd parts. 132 is not in the sequence since its binary form is 10000100 and the composition [1,4,1,2] has also even parts.
