        "Chess diagrams are chess positions without regard to whether castling or en passant capturing is possible. They are counted in A019319. A shortest proof game (SPG) is a classic type of chess problem. Most published SPGs are dual-free (have only one solution), which is why we count diagrams that are obtained in exactly one way in the minimum number of plies."
