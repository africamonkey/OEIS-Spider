    "comment": [
        "The sequence is complete. In general, a number x = x_1 x_2 ... x_n of n digits belongs to the sequence if its digits satisfy a certain Diophantine equation c_1*x_1 + c_2*x_2 + ... + c_n*x_n = 0, where the coefficients c_i depend on n. It is easy to verify that for n > 11 all the coefficient c_i are positive, so the equation does not admit a nonzero solution. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jul 20 2015"

    "formula": [
        "For a number with n digits there are n substrings generated by removing one digit from the original number. So for 12345, these are 2345, 1345, 1245, 1235, 1234. Sum(x) is defined as the sum of these substrings for a number x and the sequence above is those numbers such that sum(x) = x."
