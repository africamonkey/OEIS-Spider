    "name": "After the first two terms, each subsequent term is the smallest integer that is an outlier of the set of the previous terms, based on the criterion of 1.5 interquartile ranges above the third quartile.",
    "comment": [
        "This sequence is dependent upon the initial two terms and how quartiles are defined (e.g., do you include the median) and how many interquartile ranges above the third quartile to go."

    "example": [
        "a(8) = 18 because the third quartile of the first 7 terms is 8.5 and the interquartile range of the first 7 terms is 6, so the lower limit for outliers is 17.5 and the next higher integer is 18."
