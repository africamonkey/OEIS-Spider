        "There are A000041(k) elements of this list consisting of k bits: a partition of k written in nonincreasing order corresponds to the binary expansion which when read left to right has run lengths as listed in the partition (reading left to right forces the initial run to be of 1s). - _Jason Kimberley_, Feb 08 2013",
        "This sequence is a subsequence of A061854 (if we allow the initial 0 to be represented by the empty bit string). - _Jason Kimberley_, Feb 08 2013",
        "The positive entries are those n for which row n of A101211 is weakly decreasing. Example: 6 is in the sequence because row 6 of A101211 is [2,1]; 8 is not in the sequence because row 8 of A101211 is [1,3]. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jan 21 2018"
