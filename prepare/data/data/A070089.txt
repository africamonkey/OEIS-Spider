        "Erd\u0151s conjectured that this sequence has asymptotic density 1/2.",
        "There are 500149 terms in this sequence up to 10^6, 4999951 up to 10^7, 49997566 up to 10^8, and 499992458 up to 10^9. With a binomial model with p = 1/2, these would be +0.3, -0.5, -0.0, and -0.5 standard deviations from their respective means. In other words, Erd\u0151s's conjecture seems solid. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 27 2015"
