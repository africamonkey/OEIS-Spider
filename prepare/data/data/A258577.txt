    "comment": [
        "For an integer m, it is frequently the case that one can find a pair of primes p, r such that every nontrivial entry binomial(m,k) in the m-th row of Pascal's triangle is divisible by either p or r (or both). Indeed, we have shown by computation that one can find such a pair of primes for every m < 1 billion. We also have suggestive asymptotic density results.",
        "Since m = binomial(m,1), it is obvious that wlog p must be a divisor of m. A certain sieve result (see referenced arXiv paper) suggests that taking p to be the prime associated with the largest prime power divisor of m might be a good choice. Surprisingly, even when the sieve does not apply, this choice of p often still works. The numbers in the above sequence are the values out to m = 1 billion where this choice of p fails. The GAP program to generate these took about 2 weeks to run on a 2.9 GHz MacBook Pro from 2012.",
        "Except when m is a prime power, the problem stated above is equivalent to the problem of whether there are a pair of primes p, r such that <P,R> = A_m for any Sylow p-subgroup P and Sylow r-subgroup R of A_m. (Proved in the referenced arXiv paper.)"
