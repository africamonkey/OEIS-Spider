        "Theorem: If p is a safe prime (A005385), then n = 6p is a term of this sequence if and only if (1-1/q1)*...*(1-1/qr) + 7/12 < p/(p+1), where q1,...,qr are the distinct odd prime factors of p+1.",
        "Proof: Write p+1 = 2^a 3^b Q with gcd(Q,6)=1 and assume (p-1)/2 is prime. For n = 6p, an easy calculation yields phi(sigma(n)) + sigma(phi(n)) =  n*(1+1/p)*(2/3*(1-1/q2)*...*(1-1/qr)+7/12), where q2,...,qr are the prime factors of Q. #",
