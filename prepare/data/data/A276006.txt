        "We say there is a \"hit\" in factorial base representation (A007623) of n when there is any such pair of nonzero digits d_i and d_j in positions i > j so that (i - d_i) = j. Here the rightmost (least significant digit) occurs at position 1. This sequence gives all numbers that contain at least one such hit, meaning that there exists such a nonzero digit d_i in some position i of their factorial base representation that the digit at the position (i - d_i) is nonzero."
