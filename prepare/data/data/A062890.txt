    "comment": [
        "Partition sets of n into four parts (sides) such that the sum of any three is more than the fourth do not uniquely define a quadrilateral, even if it is further constrained to be cyclic. This is because the order of adjacent sides is important. E.g. the partition set [1,1,2,2] for a perimeter n=6 can be reordered to generate two non-congruent cyclic quadrilaterals, [1,2,1,2] and [1,1,2,2], where the first is a rectangle and the second a kite. - _Frank M Jackson_, Jun 29 2012"
