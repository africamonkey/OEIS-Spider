        "Also numbers n such that n!+R(Z(n)) is prime, where R(t)=(10^t-1)/9 is the repunit with t digits (A002275) and Z(m)=Sum_{j=1,..} floor(m/5^k) is the number of trailing zeros of m! (A027868). The (probable) prime corresponding to a(5)=1746 has 4905 digits. Next term must be greater than 4000."
