        "a(n) (n>=1) is the first Zagreb index of the triple-layered naphthalenophane G(n,n,n) having n hexagons in each layer. The first Zagreb index of a simple connected graph is the sum of the squared degrees of its vertices. Alternately, it is the sum of the degree sums d(i)+d(j) over all edges ij of the graph. The pictorial definition of G(p,q,r) can be viewed in the E. Flapan references.",
