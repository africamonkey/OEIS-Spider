        "For a given a(n) > 2, there are 2^k solutions to sqrt(-1) mod n, (for some k>=1), and 2^(k-1) solutions primitively representing a(n) by x^2 + y^2.",

        "The 2^k different solutions for sqrt(-1) mod n can written as values for j, with j<=n, such that integers r = sqrt(n*j-1). However, the set of j values (listed from smallest to largest) transform into themselves symmetrically (i.e., largest to smallest) when the solutions are written as n-r. When the same 2^k solutions are written as r-j, it is clear that only 2^(k-1) distinct and independent solutions exist. (End)"
