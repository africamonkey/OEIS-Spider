        "Same as Chebyshev's subsequence of the primes with primitive root 2, because Chebyshev showed that 2 is a primitive root of all primes p = 4*q+1 with q prime. If the sequence is infinite, then Artin's conjecture (\"every nonsquare positive integer n is a primitive root of infinitely many primes q\") is true for n = 2. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Feb 04 2013"
