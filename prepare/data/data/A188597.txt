        "The abundancy of a number n is defined to be A(n) = sigma(n)/n. Deficient numbers have an abundancy less than 2. This sequence has terms in common with A171929. Sequence A188263, which deals with abundant numbers, approaches 2 from above. The similar sequence for even numbers consists of the powers of 2.",

        "This sequence is finite iff there is an odd perfect number (which would have abundancy 2). Otherwise, one has always a subsequent term a(n+1) <= a(n)*p where p is the smallest prime not dividing a(n) and larger than 1/(2/A(a(n))-1). Indeed, such an a(n)*p is still deficient but has abundancy larger than a(n), thus closer to 2. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 22 2017"
