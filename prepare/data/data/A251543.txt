        "So far a(n) is very roughly 2^(3n-6). Of course it is not known at present if this sequence is infinite (see A098550). It is not even known if there are infinitely many prime terms in A098550. [It is now known that A098550 is a permutation of the natural numbers, so all of the primes appear. See Applegate et al. - _L. Edson Jeffery_, Dec 30 2014]",
        "a(8) appears to deviate from the formula 2^(3n-6) and is closer to 2^19 (than 2^18). - _Chai Wah Wu_, Dec 16 2014"
