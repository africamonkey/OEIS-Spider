The boundary of a calendrical period is hereby called \"blue\" w.r.t. a similarly named period in another calendar when the shorter one does not contain the boundaries of the longer one. Gregorian calendar prior to 1582 is proleptic, extrapolated according to the calculator in the links.",
    "comment": [
        "The ratio of Gregorian to Islamic Year is 365.2425/354.36666... = 438291/425240. The interesting approximating continuous fractions are 403/391, 638/619, 1041/1010 and a very long sequence of (1041+403*n)/(1010+391*n), ending with 7489/7266, so the 403/391 pattern will remain for thousands of years."
