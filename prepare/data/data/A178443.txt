    "name": "Two numbers k and l we call equivalent if they have the same vector of exponents with positive components in prime power factorization. Let a(1)=1, a(2)=3. If n>=3 is prime, then a(n) is the smallest prime greater than a(n-1); otherwise, a(n)>a(n-1) is the smallest number equivalent to n such that prime power factorization of a(n) contains only primes which already appeared in the sequence.",
    "comment": [
        "The sequence contains exactly 33 terms."
    ],
    "example": [
        "By the condition, a(12) should be more than a(11)=191. Since 12 has vector of positive exponents (2,1), then we seek already constructed prime terms p<q in the sequence and choose the smallest number of the form p^2*q>191. It is 275=5^2*11. Thus a(12)=275. Further, a(13) should be the nearest prime more than 275. It is 277."
