        "A graph on n vertices is said to be pancyclic if there are cycles of each length 3, 4, ... n in the graph."

    "example": [
        "For n = 3 the answer is 3; each of the three vertices is connected to each other vertex, forming a 3-cycle. For n = 4 we find it takes five edges and for n = 5 it takes 6."
