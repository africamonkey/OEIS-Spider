        "The corresponding partitions with 2 in the definition instead of 3 are the complete partitions, which A126796 counts.",
        "The qualifier 'into at least 4 parts' is only relevant for n = 1, 2 or 3. It is included because otherwise the condition would be vacuously true for all partitions of 1, 2 and 3. It seems neater to consider that there are no partitions of 1, 2 or 3 of this form.",

        "The valid partitions of 7 are (2, 2, 1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) and (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1). Given any partition of 7 into 4 parts, we can express these four parts as disjoint sums of elements from these partitions. For the third one this is trivial, for the second one because one element of the partition must be at least 2, for the third because in fact two elements of the partition must be at least 2. So a(7) = 3"
