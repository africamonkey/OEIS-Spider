        "There exists a K-class of Heronian triangles such that the sum of the tangents of their half angles is a constant K > 1, iff K^2-3 is the sum of two squares. E.g., for K = 2 (x=1, y=0) we generate the class of integer Soddyian triangles (see A034017, A210484). For K = 4 (x=2, y=3) the class generated is Heronian triangles with the ratio of r_i : r_o : r = 1 : 3 : 6 where r is their inradius and r_i, r_o are the radii of their inner and outer Soddy circles.",
        "Also because K^2-3 is the sum of two squares it must be congruent to 1 (mod 4). Consequently K is even."
