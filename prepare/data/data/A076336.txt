    "comment": [
        "It is only a conjecture that this sequence is complete up to 3000000 - there may be missing terms.",
        "It is conjectured that 78557 is the smallest Sierpi\u0144ski number. - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 31 2003",
        "Sierpi\u0144ski numbers are proved by exhibiting a periodic sequence p of prime divisors with p(k) | n*2^k+1 and disproved by finding prime n*2^k+1. It is conjectured that numbers that cannot be proved Sierpi\u0144ski in this way are non-Sierpi\u0144ski. However, some numbers resist both proof and disproof. - _David W. Wilson_, Jan 17 2005",
        "Sierpi\u0144ski showed that this sequence is infinite.",
        "There are 4 related sequences that arise in this context:",
        "S1: Numbers n such that n*2^k + 1 is composite for all k (this sequence)",
        "S2: Odd numbers n such that 2^k + n is composite for all k (apparently it is conjectured that S1 and S2 are the same sequence)",
        "S3: Numbers n such that n*2^k + 1 is prime for all k (empty)",
        "S4: Numbers n such that 2^k + n is prime for all k (empty)",
        "The following argument, kindly provided by Michael Reid, shows that S3 and S4 are empty:",
        "If p is a prime divisor of n + 1, then for k = p - 1, the term (either n*2^k + 1 or 2^k + n ) is a multiple of p (and also > p, so not prime).",
        "a(1) = 78557 is also the smallest odd n for which either n^p*2^k + 1 or n^p + 2^k is composite for every k > 0 and every prime p greater than 3. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Oct 12 2015"
