        "The problem arises when trying to build a square pyramid out of dominoes. The solution (m,k) = (3,7) for example corresponds to building a pyramid with layers of sizes 2 X 2, 4 X 4 and 6 X 6 from one set of double-6 dominoes.",
        "The three nonzero solutions use one double-3 set, one double-6 set and one double-83 set. (The sequence 3,6,83 is too short to warrant a separate entry.)",
        "The problem is equivalent to finding integers (m,k) such that 2m(m+1)(m+2)/3 = k*(k+1). This is a nonsingular cubic, so by Siegel's theorem, there are only finitely many solutions. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 25 2008. See also the articles by Stroeker and Tzanakis and Stroeker and de Weger. (End)"
