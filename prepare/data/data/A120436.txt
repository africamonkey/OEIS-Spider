        "Mordell shows that the only integer points on the elliptic curve y(y+1) = x(x+1)(x+2) have x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 5, corresponding to the products 0, 6, 210. However, there are infinitely many rational points generated from (x,y) = (0,0) by the chord-and-tangent process. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Oct 12 2013"
