        "A floretion-generated sequence relating truncated triangle and pyramidal numbers. The following reasoning suggests that (a(n)) may not be the result of some \"arbitrary\" addition of these sequences- it may possess some geometric meaning of its own: The FAMP identity: \"jesrightfor + jesleftfor = jesfor\" holds and was used to find the relation a(n) = 2*A051936(n+4)_4 + A051937(n+4)_4 . In the above case, \"jesfor\" returns the truncated triangular numbers (times -1); \"jesrightfor\" returns the truncated pyramidal numbers; and (a(n)) is given by \"jesleftfor\" (times -1). All sequences result from a Force transform of the sequence c(n) = n + 5 (c was not chosen arbitrarily, for details see program code). Specifically, the sequence (a(n)) is the (ForType 1A) jesleftfor-transform of the sequence c(n) = n + 5 with respect to the floretion given in the program code."
