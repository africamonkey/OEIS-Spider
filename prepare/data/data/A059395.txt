        "The pairs (5,7) and (7,11) are omitted, albeit are both consecutive primes and consecutive safe primes, however their distances (2 and 4) are singular. Cases [467, 439] and [20738027, 20738039] are pairs are both consecutive of consecutive primes and consecutive safe primes in minimal distance=12. The corresponding twins of Sophie Germain primes are [233, 239] or [1369013, 1369019] in distance 6."
