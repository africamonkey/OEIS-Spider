        "The a(n) represent the number of n-move routes of a fairy chess piece starting in the central square (m = 5) on a 3 X 3 chessboard. This fairy chess piece behaves like a bishop on the eight side and corner squares but on the central square the bishop turns into a raging elephant, see A175654.",
