        "If the {s+t} sums are generated by adding 2 terms of an S set consisting of n different entries, then at least 1, at most n(n+1)/2=A000217(n) distinct values can be obtained. The set of first n cubes gives results falling between these two extremes. E.g. S={1,8,27,...,2744,3375} provides 119 different sums of two, not necessarily different cubes:{2,9,....,6750}. Only a single sum occurs more than once: 1729(Ramanujan): 1729=1+1728=729+1000. Therefore a(15)=C[15,2]+15-119=120-119=1."
