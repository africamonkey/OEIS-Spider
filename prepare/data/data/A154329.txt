        "The next term is of order 10^17, since the next constraint is A154328(27) = 10^19 = sum of the first 10^19 digits of A154328. Even if from term 500 on there were 30 digits \"9\" in each term, their sum would stay below 10^19 for more than 3*10^16 terms. But at index 498+10^12, the value of 10^31 is reached and among the next 10^17 terms, about half of the digits will be zero."
