    "comment": [
        "The sequence of maximum sums, for which those here are the indices, is given by A101986. The formula d2 below yields n! if n is odd and n! - (n/2)! for even n. The formula for a(n) is essentially an inner product. For example, if n is 7, the result is obtained by (7 6 5 4 3 2 1) ip d2 (1 2 3 4 5 6 7) that is, (7 6 5 4 3 2 1) ip (1 1 6 22 120 714 5040) or 6959.",
        "Changing the offset to 1 would change the sequence so that it gives the greater of the two indices of the rows that yield the maximum sum of products, but for permutations one shorter in length. For example, with offset 2, index 3 is the index of the earlier row having the permutation giving maximum value for permutations of length 4; with offset 1, index 3 is the later index for the permutation giving maximum value for permutations of length 3.
