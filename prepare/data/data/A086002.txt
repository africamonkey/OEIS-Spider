        "Let rotation rot(k) of a number k be defined by swapping the blocks of the first [d/2] and of the last [d/2] digits of k, where d=A055642(k). If the number of digits in k is odd, the center digit remains untouched during rotation.",
        "So for example the rotation of 1234 is 3412, while the rotation of 12345 is 45312.",
        "Differences from A004086 appear with numbers with at least 4 digits, that is, after A004087(168) if we are concerned with primes.",
