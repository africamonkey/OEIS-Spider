    "comment": [
        "An elliptic pair over a squarefree integer d is a pair of primes (p,q) such that there exists an elliptic curve E with complex multiplication in the imaginary quadratic field with d<0 which has order q when examined over a prime field of size p.",
        "The symbol (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n)_d denotes an elliptic list of length n over d if each of (p_1,p_2), (p_2, p_3), ..., (p_{n-1}; p_n) is an elliptic pair over d. An elliptic cycle is an elliptic list with p_n = p_1. A proper elliptic cycle is one where this is the only equality among terms. The formula for the rest of the terms in a (proper) elliptic 6-cycle is given in Corollary 3.2.in the paper arXiv:1212.1983. Also, some of the results about elliptic pairs and cycles appear in arXiv:1212.1983. The resulting sequence of 6-cycles is based on work done by J. Bahr, Y. Kim, E. Neyman, and G. Taylor."
