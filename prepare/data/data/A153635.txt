        "Hardy and Wright: If there are an infinite number of these primes, then there are infinitely many cubic polynomials with integer coefficients and prime discriminant. It would also resolve the open conjecture that there are infinitely many non-isomorphic elliptic curves defined over the rationals and having prime conductor.",
