        "Only numbers > 10000 are considered, since all 4-digit primes are trivial members.",
        "By definition, each term of the sequence with more than 5 digits is built up by an overlapped union of previous terms, i.e., a(254)=182339 has the two embedded previous terms a(26)=18233 and a(208)=82339.",
        "The sequence is finite, the last term is 934919 (n=263). Proof of finiteness: Let p be a number with more than 6 digits. By the argument above, each 6-digit substring must be a previous term. The only 6-digit terms are 182339, 349199, 432713, 487793, 511933, 654799, 782339, 787793, 917333, 934919 (n=254..263, see b-file). As can be directly verified, none of them can be extended to a 7-digit number with the desired property."
