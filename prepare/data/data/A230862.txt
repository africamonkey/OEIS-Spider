        "Two variations are possible: Not requiring monotonicity (i.e., the sequence could go: ZerO, OnE, EighT, TeN, NinE, EighteeN, NineteeN, ...), and imposing the additional constraint that the sequence does not stop right after the chosen number (so \"NinetY\" would be forbidden and \"Ninety-onE\" should be used instead). See A227865 for a French and A228442 for a German version using such rules. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 03 2013"
