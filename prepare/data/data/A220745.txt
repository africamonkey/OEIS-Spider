    "comment": [
        "In the E-toothpick pattern of Omar E. Pol (see A161330 and accompanying drawings), equivalently each E-toothpick can be replaced by a rhombus (with edge or side length = 1) in an obvious way. Let r denote the area of the rhombus. The n-th iteration of the pattern is bounded by a regular hexagon with edge length n, so the total area of that n-th hexagonal region is equal to 3*n^2*r. Then after n iterations, a(n) = (total area in the bounded hexagonal region not occupied by rhombi)/r = (number of \"missing rhombi\"). The resulting pattern of the unoccupied region we call the \"complement\" of the E-toothpick pattern."
