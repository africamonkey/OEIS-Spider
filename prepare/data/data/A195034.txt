        "The spiral contains infinitely many Pythagorean triples in which the hypotenuses on the main diagonal are the positives multiples of 29 (Cf. A195819). The vertices on the main diagonal are the numbers A195038 = (21+20)*A000217 = 41*A000217, where both 21 and 20 are the first two edges in the spiral. The distance \"a\" between nearest edges that are perpendicular to the initial edge of the spiral is 21, while the distance \"b\" between nearest edges that are parallel to the initial edge is 20, so the distance \"c\" between nearest vertices on the same axis is 29 because from the Pythagorean theorem we can write c = (a^2+b^2)^(1/2) = sqrt(21^2+20^2) = sqrt(441+400) = sqrt(841) = 29. - _Omar E.
