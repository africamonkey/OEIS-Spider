    "comment": [
        "More precisely: minimum value for X=2 of primitive GF(2)[X] polynomials of degree n with at most 5 terms. Applications include maximum-length linear feedback shift registers with efficient implementation in both hardware and software. The limitation to 5 terms occurs first for a(32), which is 4294967493 representing X^32+X^7+X^6+X^2+1, rather than 4294967471 representing X^32+X^7+X^5+X^3+X^2+X^1+1. Proof is needed that there exists a primitive GF(2)[X] polynomial P[X] of degree n and at most 5 terms for all positive n."
