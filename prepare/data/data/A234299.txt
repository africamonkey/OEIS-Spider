        "The sequence is strongly associated with A072752.",
        "In A072752, you are looking for a maximum sized set of consecutive numbers where none are counted by Euler's phi(3*5*7*...*Pn); this sequence looks for a minimum sized set of consecutive numbers where all the numbers counted by Euler are included.",
        "One candidate for A (not necessarily of minimum size) is the set {1, 2, 3,..., 3*5*..*Pn}, which has the requested number of coprime elements. This yields the simple upper bound a(n) <= A070826(n+1). - _R. J. Mathar_, May 03 2017"
