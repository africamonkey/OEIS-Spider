        "All elements of this sequence, a subset of A163264, are 24 times an element of binomial(n,4) (A000332) and are, therefore, also 24 times a generalized pentagonal number (A001318) since all elements of binomial(n,4) are generalized pentagonal.",
        "Additionally, sqrt(a(n) + 1) is prime for these 7 terms. It follows that, at least to a(7), the sum of the divisors of sqrt(a(n) + 1) is a pronic number (A002378).",
        "48 = 2*(1*2*3*4)= 7^2 - 1 is the only known highly composite number one less than a square that is not a part of this sequence. 48 is also 24 times a generalized pentagonal number and one less than a prime square (also see A072825).",
        "Question: Is this sequence complete?",
