        "Many trivial terms are obtained if one drops the requirement that none of the prime factors of n be palindromes.",
        "If n is in the sequence, so is its reversal. The smallest palindrome in the sequence is 1226221 = 1021 * 1201.",

        "1469 is the product of two distinct non-palindronomic primes: 1469 = 13 * 113 and reverse(1469) = 9641 has prime factorization 9641 = reverse(13) * reverse(113) = 31 * 311. Hence 1469 belongs to the sequence."
