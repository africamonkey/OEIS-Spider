        "A k-digit number d_1 d_2 ... d_k is in this sequence if there is a multigraph with k vertices (representing the k digits) with the properties that: (1) there are at most two edges connecting d_i and d_{i+1}, and (2) there are no edges connecting d_i and d_j if i and j are not consecutive integers. In the title, \"nontrivial\" means that this multigraph must be connected (which eliminates terms like 1111 and 1122).",
