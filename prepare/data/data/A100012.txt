    "name": "Iterated hypericosahedron numbers, starting with hypericosahedron(2) = 120. The hypericosahedron numbers are 4-dimensional figurate numbers based on the 600-cell regular convex polytope, also known as the hexacosichoron or hypericosahedron. This sequence is hypericosahedron(2), hypericosahedron(hypericosahedron(2)) and so on recursively.",

        "This need not start at hypericosahedron(2) = 120. For example, starting at a(0) = 7, which is not a hypericosahedron number, we have a(1) = hypericosahedron(7) = 7*((145*7^3)-(280*7^2)+(179*7)-38)/6 = 43435; and a(2) = hypericosahedron(hypericosahedron(7)) = hypericosahedron(43435) = 43435*((145*43435^3)-(280*43435^2)+(179*43435)-38)/6 = 86011544680330349395."
