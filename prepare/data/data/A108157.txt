        "The alternating group on n letters for n>=5 odd can be generated by a 3-cycle x and an (n-2)-cycle y such that xy is an n-cycle. These are called standard generators. If we only know the orders of y and xy (and not their cycle shape) then this sequence gives values of n for which we may be misled into thinking that x and y are standard generators just by looking at their orders (y can be a permutation of shape (z-t)*t and xy can be a permutation of shape (z-s)*s).",
