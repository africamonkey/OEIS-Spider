    "comment": [
        "This is only the first walk of 10-divisibles, but it is the closest to the diagonal, and so its hedra will look the most regular for their size. It occurs only 5root2/2 moves from the diagonal. The next closest is 7root2 moves away, and is half the density.",
        "Many of these are 100-divisible. The source array contains many numbers that are multiples of high powers of 10, including a ten thousand, a 1001000, a 2005000 and a 3 million."
