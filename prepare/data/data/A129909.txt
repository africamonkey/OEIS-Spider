    "comment": [
        "Except for the first term, concatenated twin primes are always divisible by 3. This follows from the fact that twin prime components > 3 are of the form 6k-1 and 6k+1. So concatenation in decimal is (6k-1)*10^d + 6k+1 = 6k(10^d+1)+(10^d-1) where d is the number of digits in each twin prime component. Now 10^d-1 = (10-1)(10^(d-1)+10^(d-2)+...+1) = 9h and 6k(10^d+1) + 9h is divided by 3."
