        "Initial terms are 23^n, 23^(n-1)*47, 23^(n-2)*47^2,...23*47^(n-1),23^(n+1), etc. with sometime a little \"noise\" between terms (eg.: for a(12)=23*124799 between a(11)=23*47^3 and maybe a(13)=23^5). Maybe another sequence is interlaced, which would involve 23^n, 23^(n-1)*124799, etc., in which case an infinity of products of powers of 23 and powers of another prime factor may occur in the sequence. Conjecture: Next term, a(13), very probably is 23^5. Conjecture: All numbers in the sequence are multiple of 23. Conjecture: All numbers in the sequence have at most two different prime factors. - _Thomas Baruchel_, Oct 10 2003"
