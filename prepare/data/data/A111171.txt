        "This is analogous to Sophie Germain semiprimes A111153 and the chains shown are analogous to Cunningham chains of the second kind and Tomaszewski chains of the second kind. Define a 3n-1 semiprime chain of length k. This is a sequence of semiprimes s(1) < s(2) < ... < s(k) such that s(i+1) = 3*s(i) - 1 for i = 1, ..., k-1.
