        "No term is a highly composite number (A002182), since as P. Erd\u0151s noted, every highly composite number is divisible by every prime less than p; on the other hand, the sequence is a strict subsequence of A244353.",
        "Let p=prime(k), k=k(n), be the greatest prime divisor of a(n). _David A. Corneth_ noted that a(11)=4680 is the first term which is not divisible by both prime(k-2) and prime(k-1).",

        "It seems that most terms have the property mentioned in the second comment. 105753195046699200 is the first element where the three largest distinct prime divisors are consecutive primes. All other element below that number do not have that property.",

        "Intersection of A067128 and A080259, except 1. - _Michel Marcus_, May 22 2016",
        "From _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 23 2016: (Start)",
        "To explain what happens, note that, if p = p_k = prime(k), k = k(n), is the greatest prime divisor of a(n), then b(n)=a(n)*prime(k+r)/prime(k) is also in the sequence, if between a(n) and b(n) there is no a highly composite number(HCN). Indeed, d(a(n))=d(b(n)) and in the interval [a(n),b(n)] there is no number x with a geater d(x).",
        "For example, between the term 3960=2^3*3^2*5*11 and 4680=3960* 13/11  there is no HCN, so 4680 is also a term; however, between 3960 and 3960*17/11=6120 there is an HCN, so 6120 is not a term.",
        "If n is a large HCN, then its greatest prime divisor is O(log n)[Erd\u0151s]. So we can say that also prime(k)=O(log n), since, by Erd\u0151s's theorem, if n_1 is the next HCN, then n<n_1<n+n*(log n)^-c, where c>0 is constant. So if p_(k+r)/p_k<1+(log n)^-c (1) then there is a real possibility that there are numbers a(m)*p_(k+i)/p_k, i=1,..,r, which are all terms, where a(m) is between n and the next HCN. Note that (1) means that (1+o(1))*(k+r)*log(k+r)/(k*log k)<1+(log n)^-c, where k=O(log n/loglog n). Since, for r<k, log(k+r)=log k +log(1+r/k)~log k+r/k+O((r/k)^2), then log(k+r)/log k=1+O(r/(k*log k). Thus (1) means r<k/(log n)^c=O(log n)^(1-c)/loglog n. Thus if c<1, then r could be arbitrary large for sufficiently large n.",
        "  Moreover, the numerical results of _David A. Corneth_(cf. A273415) allow us to conjecture that indeed 0<c<1. (End)"
