        "Concatenation of the nonnegative integers is: 012345678910111213141516... Read the leftmost digit [0], jump accordingly *over* 0 digits and erase the one you're landing on (here, 1): you get 0(1)2345678910111213141516... (erased digits are put between parentheses). Read now the leftmost unread and visible digit [2], jump accordingly *over* 2 (visible) digits and erase the one you're landing on (5): you get 0(1)234(5)678910111213141516... Read again the leftmost unread digit [3], jump accordingly *over* 3 digits and erase the one you're landing on (8): you get 0(1)234(5)67(8)910111213141516..., etc. At the end of the (infinite) procedure, keep the integers which appear to be at the same place as in the starting concatenation but which stand also between two erased digits [something like: ...(a)15(b)...]. \"0\" and 15 are the first such \"survivors\".",
