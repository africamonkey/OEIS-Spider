        "The usual colossally abundant numbers (CANs) are defined in A004490; none of them is odd. Oddly CANs are defined similarly, except only odd primes are allowed in the factorization. It is conjectured that the ratio of consecutive oddly CANs is always a prime number. The sequence of those prime numbers is given in A110465."
