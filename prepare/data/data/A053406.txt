        "These numbers are not well-defined and the sequence is included only for completeness.",
        "The visual magnitude (m) scale is logarithmic: for two stars of brightness i1 and i2 (as seen from the Earth), the magnitude difference m1 - m2 = - log(i1/i2)*100^(1/5). Fainter stars have a higher magnitude number. Data collected by the Hipparcos satellite and exhaustive up to about 9 mag (n=10). At fainter magnitudes (n > 10), the data are increasingly fragmentary (thus the slowing rate of increase from there)."
