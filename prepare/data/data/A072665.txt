        "Borrowing from musical terminology, these could be considered \"swells\" of primality - first a crescendo (\"more prime\"), then a decrescendo (\"less prime\"). a(3), if it exists, is greater than 70750000. The corresponding sequence but counting prime factors with multiplicity (A001222) has only two terms (2, 5) because either the number immediately before or after any odd center > 5 equals 4k for some k >= 2, and thus has at least three prime factors, not exactly two, when duplicates are counted.",
