        "By a theorem of St\u00f8rmer, the number of such integers is finite; moreover he provides an algorithm for finding the complete list.",
        "St\u00f8rmer came to this problem from music theory. Another way to formulate the statement of the theorem is that for any prime p, there are only a finite number of superparticular ratios R = n/(n-1) such that R factors into primes less than or equal to p. The numerator of the smallest such R for the i-th prime is the i-th element of the above sequence. For instance, 81/80, the syntonic comma, is the smallest 5-limit superparticular \"comma\", i.e., small ratio greater than one."
