    "comment": [
        "The Artin transfer homomorphisms of the assigned second 3-class group M with SmallGroups identifier <729,54> [Besche, Eick, O'Brien] determine the capitulation type (2,0,3,4) (TKT with two fixed points 3 and 4) of the real quadratic field K in its four unramified cyclic cubic extensions N_i|K (i=1,...,4) and the abelian type invariants of the 3-class groups Cl(3,K)=(3,3) (whence A269323 is a subsequence of A269319) and [Cl(3,N_i)]=[(9,9),(9,3),(9,3),(9,3)] (TTT or IPAD). Conversely, the group M=<729,54> is determined uniquely not only by its Artin pattern AP(G)=(TTT,TKT) but even by the TTT component alone [Mayer, 2015], where TKT, TTT, IPAD are abbreviations for transfer kernel type, transfer target type, index-p abelianization data, respectively [Mayer, 2016]. Consequently, it suffices that the MAGMA program only determines the TTT component of the Artin pattern. This is an instance of the \"Principalization algorithm via class group structure\" [Mayer, 2014] and saves a considerable amount of CPU time, since the determination of the TKT component is very delicate.",
        "An important Theorem by I.R. Shafarevich [Mayer, 2015, Thm.5.1] disables the metabelian group M=<729,54> as a candidate for the 3-class tower group G, since the relation rank of M is too big. In [Mayer, 2015] it is proved that exactly the two non-metabelian groups <2187,307> and <2187,308> [Besche, Eick, O'Brien] are permitted for G, and the decision is possible with the aid of multi-layered iterated IPADs of second order (which require computing 3-class groups of number fields with absolute degree 54). Since the derived length of both groups is equal to 3, the Hilbert 3-class field tower of all these real quadratic fields has certainly exact length 3.",

However, it required seven further years to determine the pro-3 Galois group G=<2187,307|308>, with metabelianization M=G/G''=<729,54>, of the Hilbert 3-class field tower of K in August 2015. (See [Mayer, 2015] for more details.) The first 25 terms of A269323 up to 10^7 have been determined in [Mayer, 2012] and [Mayer, 2014]. The 358, resp. 4377, terms up to 10^8, resp. 10^9, have been computed by [Bush]."
