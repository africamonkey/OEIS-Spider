Graphing this function, one can see that for all n > 4 listed in the sequence, their k-values given in the first comment are well less than 0.065*n^(2.4). For large n, 0.065*n^(2.4) seems to be a large overestimate. Thus, 0.065*n^(2.4) can act as a sufficient bound for k for large n (essentially for n > 4).",
