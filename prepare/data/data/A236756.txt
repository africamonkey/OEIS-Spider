        "For n=2, there are two posets up to isomorphism. The first of which, the sum of two singletons, also has order complex with vanishing homology groups over Z. The second has an order complex with a single facet, and any interval has a contractible order complex, which therefore has vanishing homology groups. They are both Cohen-Macaulay thus a(2) = 2."
