        "Conjecture: The sequence contains infinitely many terms. In general, if a,b,c are positive integers with gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,c) = gcd(b,c) = 1, and a+b+c is even and a is not equal to b, then there are infinitely many prime pairs {p,q} such that a*prime(p) - b*prime(q) = c.",
        "See also A261362 for a stronger conjecture.",
        "Recall that a prime p is called a Sophie Germain prime if 2*p+1 is also prime. A well-known conjecture states that there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes."
