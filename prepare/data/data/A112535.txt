If you represent each variable by its truth table, A, B, ..., in 1-CNF, then the last step is 'NewTT = PrevTT and (A or B or C ...)'. For example, with four variables a, b, c and d, the 1-CNF truth table for 'a' is 0xFF00, 'not c' is 0x3333 and 'not d' is 0x5555. The corresponding step is 'NewTT = PrevTT and 0xFFBB'."
