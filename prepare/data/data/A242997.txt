    "name": "a(n) is the order of the group of invertible elements in the semigroup M whose elements are the closed binary operations on an n-point set S and whose operation (on operations, in this case) is given by x AB y = (x B y) A (y B x) for operations A and B on S and points x and y in S.",
    "comment": [
        "a(n) is also the number of permutations of the Cartesian square of an n-element set that commute with the permutation that sends each (x, y) to (y, x).",
        "More generally, for the binary operation on k-ary operations on an n-set given by cyclically permuting k inputs to one operation to obtain k outputs to use as inputs to the other operation (as when k = 3, to illustrate, AB(x, y, z) = A(B(x, y, z), B(y, z, x), B(z, x, y))), the group of invertible operations is isomorphic to the centralizer of the cyclic permutation of coordinates, in the Symmetric Group on the k-th cartesian power of the n-set, and the order of this group is Product(r divides k) Q(n, r)! r^Q(n, r) where Q(n, r) = (1/r) Sum(d divides r) Mobius(r/d) n^d."
