        "The convention here is that only the lower member of a cousin prime pair be less than the selected bound 10^n.",
        "Cousin primes, like twin primes, can be approximated by the Hardy-Littlewood formula for the number of twin primes < n. For example, the number of cousin primes < 10^12 = 1870585459 while Hardy-Littlewood gives 1870559867. The sum of cousin primes < 10^6 divided by 4 also approximates the number of cousin primes < 10^12 with 1844802199. These two methods are asymptotic to the true value as n -> infinity."
