    "name": "Consider the runs of 0's in the binary representation of n, each of these runs being on the edge of the binary representation n and/or being bounded by 1's. Consider also the runs of 1's in the binary representation of n, each of these runs being on the edge of the binary representation n and/or being bounded by 0's. A positive integer n is included in this sequence if the length of the shortest such run of 0's in binary n equals the length of the shortest such run of 1's in binary n.",

        "1564 in binary is 11000011100. The runs of 0s are like this: 11(0000)111(00). The runs of 1's are like this: (11)0000(111)00. The shortest run of 0's contains two 0's. The shortest run of 1's contains two 1's. Since both the shortest run of 0's and the shortest run of 1's are of the same length, 1564 is included in this sequence."
