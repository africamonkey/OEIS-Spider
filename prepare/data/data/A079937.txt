    "comment": [
        "The n-th greedy frac multiple of x is the smallest integer that does not cause sum(k=1..n,frac(a(k)*x)) to exceed unity; an infinite number of terms appear as the denominators of the convergents to the continued fraction of x."

        "a(4) = 45 since frac(1x) + frac(2x) + frac(14x) + frac(45x) < 1, while frac(1x) + frac(2x) + frac(14x) + frac(k*x) > 1 for all k>14 and k<45."
