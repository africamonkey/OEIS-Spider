        "This sequence collects 14-cycle-attractor elements for iteration of sum-proper-unitary-divisors. A002187 provides 1-cycle terms = unitary perfect numbers A063991 gives 2-cycle elements = unitary amicable numbers A097024 collects true 5-cycle elements i.e. terms in end-cycle of length 5 when A063919[x] function is iterated. Concerning 3-cycle elements, only {30,42,54} were encountered."
