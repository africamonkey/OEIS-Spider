        "Starting with the terms (1,2) this sequence consists of minimum increasing integer terms such that no term is the concatenation of any two or three previous distinct terms. The next consecutive numbers skipped after 121 are 122 = Concatenate(1,22) and 123 = Concatenate(1,2,3). This is the analog of a 3-St\u00f6hr sequence with concatenation (base 10) substituting for addition. A026474 is a 3-St\u00f6hr sequence."
