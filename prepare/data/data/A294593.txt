    "comment": [
        "A disjoint covering system (DCS) is a system of congruences of the form x == a_i (mod m_i) such that every integer lies in exactly one of the congruences. Here the \"moduli\" are the m_i.  The DCS is \"natural\" if it can be obtained by starting with the congruence x == 0 (mod 1) and \"splitting\":  choosing a congruence and replacing it by r congruence."
