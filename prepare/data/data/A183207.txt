        "There is a chessboard of n^2 squares. A pawn is standing on the lower left corner of the chessboard O (0,0) and its primary goal is to reach the upper right corner of the  chessboard N (n,n). The only moves allowed are diagonal shortcuts through squares. Once a square is crossed it is destroyed so that it is impossible to cross again. The secondary goal of the pawn on its way to N is to destroy as many squares as possible. a(n) is the maximum possible number of destroyed squares, provided the pawn has reached its primary goal. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Feb 23 2014"
