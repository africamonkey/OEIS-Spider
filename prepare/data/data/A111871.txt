        "The prime gaps q-p (corresponding to a(n)=p in A111870) have increasing record merit (q-p)/log(p). However, the prime gaps themselves are almost always monotonically increasing (with very high probability), but not always! And we do have an exception in the list above: a(14)=148 < a(13)=154! (But see next comment!)",
        "Because the erroneous A111870(13) = 4652353 term was removed, a(13) = 154 was removed. This sequence is therefore monotonically increasing. - _John W. Nicholson_, Nov 18 2013"
