        "Refer to Pythagoras tree (fractal) in the link. In the article \"Varying the angle\", the construction rule is changed from the standard Pythagoras tree by changing the base angle from 90 degree to 60 degree. It is easily seen that the size of the unit squares remains constant and equal to sin(30 degree)/(1/2) = 1. The first overlap occurs at the fifth generation (n=4). The general pattern produced is the rhombitrihexagonal tiling, an array of hexagons bordered by the constructing squares. a(n) gives total count of squares in n-th generation which excluding the overlap into (n-1)-th generation and count only 1 for the overlap among current one. See illustration.",
        "Conjecture: In the limit n -> infinity this construction produces one of the eight planar semiregular tesselations (one of the 11 Archimedean tesselations, the other three being regular). This is the tesselation (3,4,6,4) because of the sequence of regular 3-, 4- and 6-gons around each vertex. See the Eric Weisstein link. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Nov 23 2014"
