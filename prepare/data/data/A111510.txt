When the enclosed area is at its maximum every vertex will lie on the circumference of a circle the diameter of which divided into Triangular(n) equals Pi.",
        "There is an interesting benchmark when n=8. The radius calculated using Pi equals 5.7296...; one tenth of the number of degrees in a radian. The radius when plotted as a drawing is very near to six and, tentatively, this could be ten times a constant near to point six.",
