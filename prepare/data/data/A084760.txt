For every number r there exists some k such that a(k) - a(k-1)= r. Question: What is the longest string of consecutive integers in this sequence ( of successive differences)?",
        "Answer: 5, as exemplified by the 6 values 17 to 57. Any longer series with differences consecutive integers must include a multiple of 4, as can be seen by enumerating all possibilities modulo 4. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jul 14 2006"
