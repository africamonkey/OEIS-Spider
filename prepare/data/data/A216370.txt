    "comment": [
        "The abc conjecture (or Oesterl\u00e9-Masser conjecture) is a conjecture in number theory, first proposed by Joseph Oesterl\u00e9 and David Masser in 1985, stated in terms of three positive integers, a, b and c (whence the name), which have no common factor and satisfy a + b = c. Quantity q = log(c)/log(rad(a*b*c)) where rad(k) = A007947(k), is the product of the distinct prime factors of k. This is the q > 1 column of the wikipedia table taken from RekenMeeMetABC.nl (2011). Goldfeld (1996) described the abc conjecture as \"the most important unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis.\" Jordan Ellenberg at Quomodocumque reports on a potential breakthrough in number theory, a claimed proof of the abc conjecture by Shin Mochizuki."
