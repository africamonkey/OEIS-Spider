    "comment": [
        "Let p_n# = A002110(n) be the n-th primorial, and let t be a totative of p_n#, i.e., gcd(t, p_n#) = 1. Let q be the smallest prime totative of p_n#. We know q must be p_(n+1) by the definition of \"primorial\" as the product of the smallest n primes. This is the starting point of the range of primes we are considering. The ending point is the smallest composite totative, which is a square semiprime. This semiprime in fact must be q^2, since q is the smallest prime totative of p_n#. Stated in terms of prime n, the range we are considering are primes p_(n+1) <= t <= prevprime((p_(n+1))^2). For the smallest primorials, q^2 > p_n# with n <= 3. Thus a(n) < A054272(n) for n <= 3."
