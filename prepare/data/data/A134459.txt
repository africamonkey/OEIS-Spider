        "lcm(1..n-1) < lcm(1..n) iff n is a prime power. So the sequence consists of those n for which both n and n+1 are prime powers. By Catalan's conjecture (proved by Mihailescu), the only case where n and n+1 are both powers > 1 is n=8. Otherwise, whichever of n and n+1 is even must be a power of 2 and the other must be a prime: either a Mersenne prime if n+1 is the power of 2, or a Fermat prime if n is the power of 2. - _Robert Israel_"
