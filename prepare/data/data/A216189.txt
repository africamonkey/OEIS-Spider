        "Related to Sierpinski numbers.  These are unproved, empirical values that have been searched to large exponents (k < 1000000) for n < 131072 and (k < 250000) for larger n.  No small covering set (p < 10^11) has been found for any n < 131072.  Additional PRP testing to larger k will eliminate some terms from this sequence.",
