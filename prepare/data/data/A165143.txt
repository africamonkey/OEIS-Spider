    "comment": [
        "More mathematically, a(n) is also the biggest possible number of vertices (or edges) of a circular graph in the plane with all vertices being distinct and having integer coordinates between 1 and n, inclusive, and all edges having length sqrt(5).",
        "Opinions on a(1) and a(2) may differ: The only possible circular path consists of staying at the starting field, hence we have 1 field visited (thus a(1) = a(2) = 1) or it takes 0 knight moves to complete the tour (thus a(1) = a(2) = 0). The graph with one vertex and no edges is not considered a cyclic graph since all vertices must have degree two; even adding a loop edge would produce an edge of length 0 (thus a(1) and a(2) are either undefined or = 0 if one accepts the empty graph as cyclic)."
