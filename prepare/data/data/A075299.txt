    "comment": [
        "290 is conjectured (cf. A066450) to be the smallest number such that the Reverse and Add! algorithm in base 4 does not lead to a palindrome. Unlike 318 (cf. A075153) its trajectory does not exhibit any recognizable regularity, so that the method by which the base 4 trajectory of 318 as well as the base 2 trajectories of 22 (cf. A061561), 77 (cf. A075253), 442 (cf. A075268) etc. can be proved to be palindrome-free (cf. Links), is not applicable here."
