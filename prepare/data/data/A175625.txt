        "All composites in this sequence are 2-pseudoprimes, A001567. That subsequence begins 536870911, 46912496118443, 192153584101141163, with no other composites below 2^64 (the first two were found by 'venco' from the dxdy.ru forum). Many composite members of this sequence are of the form (2^k + 1)/3, starting with k = 47, 59, 83, 107, 179, 227, 263, 359, 383, ..., with 112 such k below 10000. The only known composite member not of this form is a(1018243) = 536870911.",
