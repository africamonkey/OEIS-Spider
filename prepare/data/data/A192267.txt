        "An anti-deficient number is a number n for which sigma*(n)<n, where sigma*(n) is the sum of the anti-divisors of n. Like A005100 but using anti-divisors. There are only 22 anti-deficient numbers less than 100, 159 less than 1000 and 1547 less than 10000. From an empirical observation it seems that the anti-deficient are approximately less than 18% of the anti-abundant."
