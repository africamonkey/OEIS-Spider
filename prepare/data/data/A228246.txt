        "A first-to-n match is continuing up to n wins of one of two chessplayers. For example, in matches A. Karpov - V. Korchnoi (1978; 1981) it was taken n=6;",
        "in match B. Fischer - B. Spassky (1992) it was taken n=10.",
        "In chess, as also in some other kinds of sport, e.g., football, the score k:m is called \"big\", if |k-m|>=3. It is interesting that, e.g., a(6) = 9 corresponds to a big score 6:3, while a(10) = 16 corresponds to a big score 10:6. Thus a moderately big score in such matches is not a reason to revise a relative relation of strengths of the winner and the loser."
