        "There is currently some question whether Pluto should be considered a planet and whether some other objects should also be considered planets. This uses the list of planets in common usage at this time. Values in this sequence will gradually change with time, primarily due to changes in the Earth's rotational period; but any changes will take a long time, particularly for the inner planets."
