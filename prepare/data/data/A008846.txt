        "All primitive Pythagorean triangles with sides {a, b, c} where a = a(n) are hypotenuses, \"b\" is the even leg, and \"c\" is the odd leg, have the property that Sqrt(a+b) = t, which is an odd integer, and t is a divisible into c.  This property derives from the fact that all primitive Pythagorean triangles can be from generated from two integers, j<i, as {j^2-i^2,2ij,j^2+i^2}. Also note: t = c only when the longer leg equals to a(n)-1. - _Richard R. Forberg_, May 11 2016"
