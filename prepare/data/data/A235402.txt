        "Cramer (1936) sets up his probabilistic model of primes as follows: \"Let U1, U2, U3, ... be an infinite series of urns containing black and white balls, the chance of drawing a white ball from Un being 1/(log n) for n>2, while the composition of U1 and U2 may be arbitrarily chosen. We now assume that one ball is drawn from each urn, so that an infinite series of alternately black and white balls is obtained.\" White balls simulate \"primes\", and black balls are \"composites\".",
        "Note that the model, as stated, is underdetermined: the content of urns U1 and U2 is arbitrary. To compute exact distributions of maximal gaps, here we assume that",
        "U1 is empty \u2014 it produces neither \"primes\" nor \"composites\";",
        "U2 always produces white balls (i.e. the number 2 is certain to be \"prime\").",
        "It is not guaranteed that there are any \"primes\">2 at all. To circumvent this, we define the maximal prime gap as 1 + the longest run of \"composites\" observed in a given experiment with n urns."
