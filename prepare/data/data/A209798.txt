    "comment": [
        "A partition of the set [n] is a family nonempty disjoint sets whose union is [n].  The blocks are written in order of increasing minima.  A partition of the set [n] can be written as a word p=p_1p_2...p_n where p_i=j if element i is in block j.  A partition q=q_1q_2...q_n contains partition p=p_1p_2...p_k if there is a subword q_{i_1}q_{i_2}...q_{i_k} such that q_{i_a}<q_{i_b} whenever p_a<p_b, these words are called order isomorphic.  A colored partition q contains the colored partition p in the pattern sense if there is a copy of the uncolored partition p in the uncolored partition q, and the colors on this copy of p are order isomorphic to the colors on p, otherwise we say q avoids p in the pattern sense."
