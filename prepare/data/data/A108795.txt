        "Checked by Jack Brennen to 5.93*10^10 and in fact every number beyond 14384056005 was divisible by at least two odd-prime-fourth-powers. C(2*14384056005,14384056005) seems to be the last such number which is only divisible by a single odd-prime-fourth-power, being divisible by 5^9 but by no other prime more than 3 times."
