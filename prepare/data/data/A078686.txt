        "The original definition (\"Primes p such that the minimum value of |p-2^x|, x>0, is also a prime\") produces A188677, not the terms shown here. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 01 2011.",
        "The mystery of this definition was solved by _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jul 06 2014, who also remarks that if instead we ask for odd primes, and therefore the index is one less than that for all primes, the sequence would begin: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 37, 61, 233, 257, 1553, 2879, 4919, 6389, 7621, 8081, 35593, 37951, 96263, 206419, ..., . If we count 1 amongst the primes (A008578), then the sequence would begin: 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 167, 193, 197, 433, 4111, 9173, 42929, 95279, 98897, 139409, 142567, 228617, ..., ."
