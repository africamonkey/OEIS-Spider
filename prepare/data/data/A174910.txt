        "Partial sums of numbers n such that iterated sum of digits of n is a prime; equivalently, partial sums of numbers n such that n modulo 9 is an element of {2,3,5,7}. The sequence seems sparse with primes at first, the subsequence of primes beginning: 2, 5, 17, 2801, and no others through a(54)."
