        "The conjecture a(n) = A001912(n)^2 (mentioned in the formula part) is easy. In fact, any prime divisor of 4*n^2 + 1 is congruent to 1 modulo 4 and hence it can be written as a sum of two squares. Thus 4*n^2 + 1 = (2*n)^2 + 1^2 is composite if and only if it can be written as a sum of two squares in at least two ways. So the conjecture follows immediately. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Feb 23 2014",
        "Positive squares that are the sum of two triangular numbers in exactly one way. Note that each positive square is the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers since A000217(n) + A000217(n+1) = n*(n+1)/2 + (n+1)*(n+2)/2 = (n+1)^2. - _Altug Alkan_, Jul 06 2016"
