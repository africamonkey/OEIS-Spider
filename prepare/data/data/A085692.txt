        "The problem of whether there are any other terms in this sequence, Brocard's problem, has been unsolved since 1876. It is virtually certain that there are no other terms and the known calculations give a(4) > (10^9)! = factorial(10^9). - _Stefan Steinerberger_, Mar 19 2006",
        "I wrote a similar program sieving against the 40 smallest primes larger than 4*10^9 and can report that a(4) > factorial(4*10^9+1). In other words, it's now known that the only n <= 4*10^9 for which n!+1 is a square are 4, 5 and 7. C source code available on request. - Tim Peters (tim.one(AT)comcast.net), Jul 02 2006"
