Helenius (fredh(AT)ix.netcom.com): Let k be the largest element (the \"dictator\") in S and let j be the sum of the remaining elements, so 0 <= j < k. For a given k and j, the number of subsets S is just the number of partitions j into distinct parts; call that a(j). Then b(n) = Sum_{1<=k<=n} Sum_{0<=j<k} a(j). This was independently discovered by _N. J. A. Sloane_ and proved by _Michael Reid_.",
