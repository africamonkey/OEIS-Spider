        "We study words made of letters from an alphabet of size b, where b >= 1. (Here b=9.) We assume the letters are labeled {1,2,3,...,b}. There are b^n possible words of length n.",
        "We say that a word is in \"standard order\" if it has the property that whenever a letter i appears, the letter i-1 has already appeared in the word. This implies that all words begin with the letter 1.",

        "This sequence can be potentially expanded by a much more efficient algorithm than the brute-force one presented in the program section."
