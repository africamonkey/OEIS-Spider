        "This sequence is a subsequence of A032766.  Proof: since Fibonacci(0) = 0 and Fibonacci(1) = 1, Fibonacci(n) mod 2 has the pattern: 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ..., i.e. if n mod 3 = 0, then Fibonacci(n) is even, and n-1 is not a member of this sequence.  In other words, members of this sequence must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod 3. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Jun 04 2015"
