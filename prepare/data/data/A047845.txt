        "This sequence also arises in the following way: take the product of initial odd numbers i.e. the product (2n+1)!/(n!2^n) and factor it into prime numbers. The result will be of the form 3^n(3)5^n(5)7^n(7)11^n(11).... . Then n(3)/n(5) = 2, n(3)/n(7) = 3,n(3)/n(11) = 5,... and this sequence forms (for sufficiently large n, of course) the sequence of natural numbers without 4,7,10,12,... i.e. these numbers are what is lacking in the present sequence. - Andrzej Staruszkiewicz (uszkiewicz(AT)poczta.onet.pl), Nov 10 2007",

Adapting Skip Garibaldi's terms, sequence A053726 would be \"flag long numbers\" because those patterns begin and end with the long lines.
