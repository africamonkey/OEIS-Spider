    "comment": [
        "Given an ordered sequence of n elements (1,2,3,...,n), let X represent the permutation that transposes the first two elements, X(1,2,3,...,n) = (2,1,3,...,n), let L be the \"left rotation\" of the sequence, L(1,2,3,...,n) = (2,3,...,n,1), and let R be the \"right rotation\", R(1,2,3,...,n) = (n,1,2,...,n-1). Then every permutation of (1,2,3,...,n) can be expressed as a composition of the permutations X, L and R. One can exhaustively generate such compositions by taking L=\"0\", X=\"1\", R=\"2\", and considering, in turn, base 3 numbers of increasing length (padded with leading zeros).  Note that any base 3 number containing the subsequence \"11\", \"02\" or \"20\" may be discarded.",
        "Note also that by defining the distance between any two permutations p and q in S_n, dist(p,q), to be the length of the minimal composition of LXR transforming p into q, we have dist(p,q) = dist(q,p), owing to L and R being mutually inverse, and X being self-inverse."

    "example": [
        "The diameter of S_5 is 10, given this set of generators, since there is no sequence shorter than 0010010121 (i.e., LLXLLXLXRX) that will transform (1,2,3,4,5) into (2,1,5,4,3), and there is no permutation of (1,2,3,4,5) that requires more than a length-10 composition of L, X, and R. Thus a(5) = 10."
