        "First differences are also not divisible by 4. - _Zak Seidov_, Jun 23 2015",
        "Starting with 3, group the primes into runs of consecutive primes either all == 1 (mod 4) or all == 3 (mod 4). Only the last prime of each run appears in this sequence. Since the runs alternate == 1 (mod 4) and == 3 (mod 4), so do the members of this sequence. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jun 23 2015",
        "The sequence is infinite, by Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. The sequence contains arbitrarily long gaps, by Daniel Shiu's theorem on strings of congruent primes (see A057619 and A057622). Conjecture: The sequence contains arbitrarily long strings of consecutive primes (see A289118). - _Jonathan Sondow_, Jun 25 2017"
