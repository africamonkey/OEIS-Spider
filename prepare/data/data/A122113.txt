    "comment": [
        "Biconnected means \"at least 2-connected\". The corresponding sequence for 3-connected bipartite planar graph is A007028, where the term \"polyhedral graph\" is used as shorthand for \"3-connected planar graph\"."
    ],
    "example": [
        "a(4) = 1 because the 4-cycle is the only planar and bipartite graph on 4 vertices that is at least 2-connected and a(5) = 1 because the complete bipartite graph K2,3 is the only such graph on 5 vertices."
