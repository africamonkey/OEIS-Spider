        "Polynomial cubic of Euler's V,F,E: V=E-F+2 P(x)=(x-V)*(x-F)*(x+E) =x^3+(E-V-F)*x^2+(V*F-E(V+F))*x=E*F*V letting (E-V-F)=-2 V+F=E+2 and product: p=V*F I got P(x)=x3-2*x2+(p-E*(E+2))*x+E*p Setting that polynomial equal to zero gives roots that agree with Euler's equation. In the exceptional groups: ( down to two integer variables) p=16*m ; m-> {1,3,15} E=6*n ; n->{1,2,5} The program works to produce the right roots for {-E,V,F}"
