        "Start with decimal expansion of pi: s0=3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5,8,9,7,9,3,2,3,8,4,6,2,6,4,3,3,8,3,2,7,9,5,0,2,8,8,4,1,9,7,1,6,9,3,9,9,3,7,5,1,0,5,8,2,0,9,7,4,9,4,4,5,... Divide s0 to the sections with the same final digits: s={3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3}, {5,8,9,7,9,3,2,3,8,4,6,2,6,4,3,3,8,3,2,7,9,5}, {0,2,8,8,4,1,9,7,1,6,9,3,9,9,3,7,5,1,0}, {5,8,2,0,9,7,4,9,4,4,5},... Then A104865(n) = length of s(n): 10,22,19,11,... A104866(n) = initial/final digits of s(n): 3,5,0,5,... A104867 gives records in A104865. A104871 gives positions of records A104867 in A104865."
