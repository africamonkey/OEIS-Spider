    "comment": [
        "The game is played on an edge-colored graph by two players called Builder and Painter. The game starts with a graph on infinitely many vertices with no edges. In each step, Builder adds one new edge to the graph, but he must not create any cycles, and all components (=trees) may have at most k edges (k is fixed throughout the game). Painter immediately and irrevocably colors each new edge red or blue. Painter's goal is to avoid creating a monochromatic (i.e., completely red or completely blue) path P(n) on n edges (n is also fixed throughout the game). Builder's goal is to force Painter to create such a monochromatic P(n). a(n) is defined as the minimal k for which Builder wins this P(n)-avoidance game with two colors and tree size restriction k."
