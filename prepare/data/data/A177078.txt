        "Positive integers not multiples of any element except 1 of A000124. Complement of multiples of central polygonal numbers (other than multiples of 1, which are all integers) = {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, ...}. This is to squarefree numbers (A005117), i.e. numbers that are not divisible by a square greater than 1, as central polygonal numbers (A000124) are to squares (A000290)."

It is redundant to eliminate all multiples of A000124(2) = 4 as those were all eliminated in the previous step. Now eliminate all multiples of A000124(3) = 7. Now eliminate all multiples of A000124(4) = 11. Continue through eliminating all multiples of A000124 elements >1 through N and one has all elements of this new sequence through N^2."
