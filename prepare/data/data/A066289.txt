        "Tested for each n and k<200. Otherwise the proof for all k seems laborious, since the number of divisors of terms of sequence rapidly increases: {1, 4, 16, 24, 96, 96, 2304, ...}.",

However, there are none in Achim's list of multiperfect numbers (see A007691); Richard C. Schroeppel has suggested that that list is complete to 10^70 - if so, a[1..12] are correct; as for a(13), Rich says there's only \"an epsilon chance that some undiscovered MPFN lies in the gap.\" So it is very likely to be correct. - Don Reble"
