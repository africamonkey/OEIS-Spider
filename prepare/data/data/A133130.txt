    "comment": [
        "For each n we define an undirected labeled graph (with self loops), where the vertices are labeled with strings from {0,1}^n and there is an edge between two vertices exactly when we can form a 2 X n rectangle whose rows are the two labels and the 2 X n rectangle has no monochromatic 2 X 2 subsquares. a(n) is the number of walks of length n in this graph. Thus it is the sum of all of the entries of A^n, where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph."
