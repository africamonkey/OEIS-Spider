        "This can been seen as a 4-dimensional parallel to the 3-dimensional A099179 (Iterated tetrahedral numbers) and 2-dimensional A007501 Iterated triangular numbers. This need not start at 2. For example, starting at a(0) = 17, which is not a pentatope number, we have a(1) = Ptop(17) = 17*(17+1)*(17+2)*(17+3)/24 = 4845 = 3 * 5 * 17 * 19 {which happens to be the product of two twin-prime pairs); a(2) = Ptop(Ptop(17)) = Ptop(4845) = 4845*(4845+1)*(4845+2)*(4845+3)/24 = 22988020743780."
