        "The T operator numerically summarizes the frequency of digits 0 through 9 in that order when they occur in a number. The numbers and the frequency are written in base 10.",
        "These are all autobiographical numbers in base 10 which lead to a fixed-point or belong to a cycle.",
        "109 numbers are fixed-points. There are 31 cycles with length 2 (62 numbers) and 10 cycles with length 3 (30 numbers)."
