        "From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 30 2016: (Start)",
        "Proof: If the 3 (mod 4) number  4*k-1 is composite it can be written as a product of a number a == 3 (mod 4) and powers of numbers 1 (mod 4), that is as a product of",
        "  a = 4*x-1 and b = 4*y+1. Then  4*k-1 = (4*x-1)*(4*y+1) or k = 4*x*y + x - y. And conversely, if k = 4*x*y + x - y then 4*k-1 = (4*x-1)*(4*y+1), that is composite.",
        "The example of _Vincenzo Librandi_ below is equivalent to \"numbers m that can be written as 4*H*K + 3*H + K +1 for H>0, K>0\" (consider h, k of opposite parity, which is necessary to have even 2*h*k + k + h + 1. W.l.o.g. take h = 2*H and k = 2*K+1). Then 4*m - 1 = (4*K+3)*(4*H+1). This is equivalent to _Ron R Spencer_'s statement with K=x-1, H=y. (End)"
