    "comment": [
        "The sum of the reciprocals of the lower bound twin primes is convergent. Proof: If S1 = 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/11 + 1/17 . . . is divergent then S1 + (S2 = 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/13 + 1/19 . . .) is divergent. But S1+S2 = 1/3+1/5 + 1/5+1/7 + 1/11+1/13 ... was proved to be convergent by V. Brun in 1919. So S1 is not divergent and since it is not oscillating, it is convergent as stated."
