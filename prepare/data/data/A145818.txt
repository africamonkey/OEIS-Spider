        "Theorem. A positive odd number is in the sequence iff in its binary expansion all bits in the k-th position from the end, for k=2, 4, 6, ..., are zeros. For example, 337, 341 have binary expansions 101010001, 101010101. Thus both of them are in the sequence. If A(x) is the counting function of a(n)<=x, then A(x)=O(sqrt(x))and Omega(sqrt(x)). If f(x)=sum_{n>=1}x^a(n), abs(x)<1, then f(x)*f(x^2)=x^3/(1-x^4); a(n)=2A145812(n)-1.",
        "Every positive odd integer m==3 (mod 2^(2r)) is a unique sum of the form a(2^(r-1)*(s-1)+1)+a(2^(r-1)*(t-1)+1),r=1,2,..., while other odd integers are not expressible in such form (see also comment to A145812). [From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Oct 21 2008]",
        "To get the decomposition of m=4k+3 as sum a(l)+2a(s), write m-2 as Sum b_j 2^j, then a(s) = 1 + Sum_{j odd} b_j 2^(j-1). For example, if m=55, then we have: 53=2^0+2^2+2^4+2^5. Thus a(l)=1+2^4 =17 and the required decomposition is: 55=a(l)+2*17,such that a(l)=21. We see that l=4,s=3, i.e. \"index coordinates\" of 55 are (4,3). Thus we have a one-to-one map of positive integers of the form 4k+3 to the positive lattice points on the plane. [From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Oct 26 2008]"
