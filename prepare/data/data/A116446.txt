    "name": "Let Sq(n) denote the square grid consisting of all lattice points (x,y) such that x,y are in {0,1,...,n}. a(n) is the minimum number t such that there are t of the (n+1)^2 lattice points in Sq(n) so that the binomial(t,2) lines that they determine cover all points in Sq(n).",

        "No exact values are given in the paper by Alon, however one will find there upper and lower bounds involving unknown constants for the d-dimensional generalization of this sequence.",
        "The upper bound a(n)<=2(n+1) is found by choosing n+1 lines parallel to one of the square's edges, fixed by 2(n+1) points on 2 opposite edges of the grid. Another upper bound a(n)<=3+A018805(floor[(n+1)/2]) is obtained by placing one point at the grid center (n even) or at one of the 4 grid points closest to the center (n odd), then letting 2+A018805(...) lines intersect there. - _R.

        "Because each line covers at most n-1 unchosen points, we have (n-1) * binomial(t,2) >= (n-1)^2 - t, yielding a lower bound of a(n) >= ceil((n-3+sqrt(8n^3+9n^2-14n+1))/(2*(n-1))).",
        "Can be formulated as an integer linear programming problem as follows. Let binary variable x[i,j] = 1 if lattice point (i,j) is chosen, and 0 otherwise. Let binary variable y[k] = 1 if line k is chosen, and 0 otherwise. The objective is to minimize sum x[i,j]. Let L[k] denote the set of lattice points on line k. The covering constraint for lattice point (i,j) is sum {k: (i,j) in L[k]} y[k] >= 1. To enforce the rule that y[k] = 1 implies sum {(i,j) in L[k]} x[i,j] >= 2, impose the linear constraint sum {(i,j) in L[k]} x[i,j] >= 2 * y[k]. (End)"
