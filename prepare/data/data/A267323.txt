        "The strategic pile of permutation P=[a_1,...,a_n] is obtained from the disjoint cycle decomposition of the composition of the cycles (a_n, ..., a_1,0)(0,1, 2, ..., n). If 0 and n are not in the same cycle, the strategic pile of P is empty. Else, the terms appearing from n to 0, not including n or 0, in the cycle (n, ..., 0, ...) is the strategic pile of P.",
        "The strategic pile of P=[3,2,4,1] is {1, 2, 3} which has size 3 because: (1,4,2,3,0)(0,1,2,3,4) = ( 4, 1, 3, 2, 0)"
