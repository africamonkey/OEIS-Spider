If A(p1) and A(p2) are two permutation matrices corresponding to permutations p1 and p2 the closed interval between these two matrices forms an edge of the polytope iff the permutation p1*(p2^-1) is a cycle, i.e. its cycle decomposition in the symmetric group S_n contains exactly one nontrivial cycle."
