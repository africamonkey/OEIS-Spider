    "comment": [
        "A cyclic Carlitz composition is a composition of length greater than one where adjacent parts, including the first and the last ones, are distinct. A composition of length one is also considered cyclic and Carlitz. Assume two cyclic Carlitz compositions are considered equivalent iff one can be obtained from the other by a rotation or reversal of order. Each equivalence class obtained is called a dihedral Carlitz composition of n."
