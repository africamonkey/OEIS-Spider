        "On a 3Xn grid of points, a triangle can either have 2 points on one line and 1 point on another line (for a total of 6*n*binomial(n,2) ways) or one point on each line (in n^3 - Q ways, where Q is the number of degenerate triangles formed by collinear triples with one point on each line).",
        "Q is equal to n (for vertical triples) plus 2*floor((n-1)^2/4) (since a downward-sloping diagonal passing through the points (1,i), (2,i+d), (3,i+2d), say, where i >= 1, i+2d <= n, can be drawn in Sum_{i=1..n-2} floor((n-i)/2) ways, and this sum is equal to floor((n-1)^2/4), as can be seen by considering the row sums of the triangle A115514).",
        "So a(n) = 6*n*binomial(n,2) + n^3 - (n + 2*floor((n-1)^2/4)), which simplifies to give the above formula. (End)",
