        "In 1911 Toeplitz conjectured the Square Peg (or Inscribed Square) Problem: Every continuous simple closed curve in the plane contains 4 points that are the vertices of a square. The conjecture is still open. Many special cases have been proved; see Matschke's beautiful 2014 survey.",
        "Recently van Heijst proved that any real algebraic curve in R^2 of degree d inscribes either at most (d^4 - 5d^2 + 4d)/4 or infinitely many squares. He conjectured that a generic complex algebraic plane curve inscribes exactly (d^4 - 5d^2 + 4d)/4 squares."
