        "Definition: Extremal points on the Mordell elliptic curve x^3-y^2=d are points (x,y) such that x^3 - round(sqrt(x^3))^2 = d. For values d for successive x independent of the extensions see A077119.",

        "Terms free of such k are primary terms see A201047. Secondary terms are e.g.: a(6)=a(2)*2^2, a(7)=a(3)*2^2, a(17)=a(10)*2^2, a(18)=a(11)*2^2, a(19)=a(12)*2^2, a(21)=a(10)*3^2.",
