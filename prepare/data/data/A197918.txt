        "It is conjectured that with the exception of the first three terms (2,5,17) all of the terms are a subset of all primes p such that p XOR 22 = p + 22.",
        "If the inequality in the definition is replaced with equality the result are the Mersenne primes A000668, which is equivalent to for all primes q<p p XOR q = p - q. This is a direct result of the binary nature of Mersenne primes being all \"1's\", smaller numbers XORed with them will return the difference. This sequence is a kind of mirror of that, as for no primes q<p p XOR q = p - q.",
        "This sequence is apparently a subset of A081091 Primes of the form 2^i + 2^j + 1, i>j>0, with the added conditions that j <> 1 or 2, and if j can be written as 2n then i cannot be 2n+1.
