        "Writing u for a Fibonacci product and v for a Lucas product, the numbers in A274426 are represented by the infinite word uuvuuvuuvvuuuvvuuuvvv... This is the concatenation of uuv and the words (u^k)(v^(k-1))(u^k)(v^k) for k >= 2. Thus, there are runs of Lucas products of every finite length and runs of Fibonacci products of every finite length except 1.",
