        "The Mathematica notebook can compute 30 or 40 iterations, and colors them with period 5. You could also change out images if you want to. These graphs are better for analyzing 5-iteration chunks of the pattern. You can see that under iteration all fragments of the circumferences are preserved in shape and translated outwards a distance approximately sqrt(21) (relative to small triangle edge), the length of a long diagonal of larger rhombus unit cell. The conjectured recurrence should follow from an analysis of how new pieces occur in between the translated pieces. - _Bradley Klee_, Nov 26 2014"

Then the code computes the distance from each node to the central node of the grid."
