        "There are a surprising number of small terms in this sequence.",
        "Heuristic: The square root of x has an average distance of 1/4 to an integer, so |x - round(sqrt(x))^2| is around |x - (sqrt(x) - 1/4)^2| or about sqrt(x)/2, hence A260374(n) is around sqrt(n!)/2. By Stirling's approximation this is around (n/e)^(n/2) which is a square with probability (n/e)^(-n/4). The integral of this function converges, so this sequence should be finite. This heuristic is crude, though, because it does not model the extreme values of A260374. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 23 2015",
