        "Sequence A085824 lists the indices n for which A037053(n) has only two nonzereo digits, i.e., A037053(n) = a*10^(n+1) + b, with 1 <= a,b <= 9.",
        "It is conjectured that, apart from A037053(0) = 2, all other terms have three nonzero digits and are therefore of the form A037053(n) = a*10^(n+2) + b*10^k + c, where 1 <= a,b,c <= 9 and 1 <= k <= n+1.",
        "Whenever 1 < k < n+1, the n digits '0' are not consecutive but separated in two \"chunks\" of length n-k+1 and k-1, respectively. These indices n are listed here.",
        "I conjecture that k < n+1 for all n (where k is function of n, of course).",
        "For most indices n listed here, the smallest prime with n consecutive digits '0' is of the above form with k = n+1, i.e., of the form ab0...0c = (10a+b)*10^(n+1) + c.",
        "The first index n for which this is not the case remains to be found. It can be expected that for this index n, the least prime with n consecutive digits '0' is either of the form a0...0b0c = a*10^(n+3) + b*100 + c (in which case it equals A037053(n+1)) or of the form a0...0bc with a > 9 (in which case it equals A037053(n+1) if a = 0 (mod 10)).",
