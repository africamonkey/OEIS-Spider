        "The interval between terms reflects the number of ways a square integer can be partitioned into the sum of two square integers in an ordered pair.  As examples, the increase from a(1) to a(2) from 1 to 3 is due to the inclusion of (1,2) and (2,1); and the increase from a(2) to a(3) is due to the inclusion of (2,2).  Larger intervals occur when there are more combinations, such as, between a(17) and a(18) when (1,7), (7,1), and (5,5) are included."
