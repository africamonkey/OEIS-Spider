        "The polygons and the hole are self-avoiding and mutually-avoiding, i.e. no degree four vertices are allowed. Translations are allowed, rotations and reflections are not allowed. The contribution of the holes to the perimeter is counted. The number of the holes is not limited, possibly no holes."
