        "There is the sequence SemiprimePi for semiprimes ==1 (mod 4) which grows as 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10,... and another SemiprimePi for == 3 (mod 4) which grows as 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5,... We watch the difference 0, 0, -1, -1, -1, 0, -1, -1, -2, -2, -3, -3, -2,.. and note the semiprimes where this difference becomes >0."
