        "The first pedal of a triangle has as its vertices the feet of the perpendiculars of the original triangle. The (n+1)st pedal is the pedal of the n-th pedal.",
        "From Fortschritte JFM 34.0551.02 on the Valyi paper: The triangle with corners the altitude bases of a given triangle ABC are called pedal triangles. The pedal triangle of this triangle is the second pedal triangle. Generally, we understand the n-th pedal triangle of the triangle ABC to be the pedal triangle of the (n-1)th pedal triangle. The author searches for and counts all triangles that are similar to their n-th pedal triangle, where all mutually similar triangle are counted as one.",
        "The number of these is psi(n)=2^n(2^n-1). The number of triangles for which the n-th pedal triangle is the first that is similar to it is Sum_{d|n} mu(n/d) psi(d), where mu is the M\u00f6bius function. The author ends with a table of those triangles that are similar to their first, 2nd and 3rd pedal triangles.",
        "Also, the number of 2 X n binary matrices that are \"primitive\"; that is, they cannot be expressed as a \"tiling\" by a smaller matrix; cf. A265627. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Dec 11 2015"
