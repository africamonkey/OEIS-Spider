        "Also numbers that cannot be expressed as the two-digit numbers a b (base r) and b a (base s) for two different smaller bases r and s (i.e., 2-digit \"reversals\"), and the numbers that cannot be expressed as \"reversals\" of any length for two different smaller bases. I can prove this. - _Francis J. McDonnell_, Jul 28 2015"
