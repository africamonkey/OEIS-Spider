        "There is no prime a(8) since 293999991 to 293999999 are all composite.",
        "This is also one of five longest possible sequences of primes where each term is formed by appending a digit to the previous term. Alternatively, one can view 29399999 as a prime where truncating the last digit successively always produces a prime. These are called Right-truncatable primes and the other four with 8 digits are 23399339, 37337999, 5939339 and 73939133. A list of all 83 possible Right-truncatable primes can be found in links for A024770. I have independently verified that this list is complete."
