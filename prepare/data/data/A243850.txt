        "Decree that (row 1) = (1), (row 2) = (2), and (row 3) = (3).  For n >= 4, row n consists of numbers in decreasing order generated as follows:  x+1 for each x in row n-1 together with 2/x for each x in row n-1, and duplicates are rejected as they occur.  Then a(n) = (number of numbers in row n); it appears that this sequence is not linearly recurrent."
