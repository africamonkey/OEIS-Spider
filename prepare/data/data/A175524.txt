        "All odd primes (A065091) are in the sequence. Squares of the form (2^n+3)^2, n>=3, where 2^n+3 is prime (A057733), are also in the sequence. [Proof: (2^n+3)^2 = 2^(2*n)+2^(n+2)+2^(n+1)+2^3+1. Thus, since n>=3, A000120((2^n+3)^2)=5. Also, for primes of the form 2^n+3, (2^n+3)^2 has only two proper divisors, 1 and 2^n+3, so A000120(1)+A000120(2^n+3) = 4, and in conclusion, (2^n+3)^2 is deficient. QED]",
