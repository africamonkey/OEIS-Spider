        "For odd n > 2, it seems that a(n) is about 25 * 10^(n-3) + 10^(floor((n-1)/2)), although a(13) breaks that pattern. - _David A. Corneth_, May 22 2016",
        "Except for n = 1 and 13, a(n) appears to be approximately equal to either 25*10^(n-3)+sqrt(10^(n-1)) (for n = 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 18, ... ) or 25*10^(n-3)+sqrt(2*10^(n-1)) (for n = 4, 7, 8, 14, 16, 17, ...). For n = 1, a(n) is approximately 25*10^(n-3)+sqrt(3*10^(n-1)) and for n = 13, a(n) is about equal to 25*10^(n-3)+sqrt(4*10^(n-1)). Conjecture: a(n) is always  approximately to 25*10^(n-3)+sqrt(k*10^(n-1)) for some small integer k > 0. - _Chai Wah Wu_, May 22 2016",
        "Using the above conjecture as a guide, upper bounds for a(n) can be computed (see file in links) which coincide with a(n) for n <= 19. - _Chai Wah Wu_, May 23 2016"
