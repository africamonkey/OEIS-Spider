        "This is a version of A242720 with the absolute minima of k in the definition. The sequence is nondecreasing. Hypothetically, every pair {a(n)-3, a(n)-1} is a pair of twin primes.",
        "If there exist infinitely many n such that a(n) < A242719(n) < a(n)^2, then from the result in the Shevelev link, it follows that for such n the set of numbers {even k: lpf(k-1) > lpf(k-3) >= prime(n)} either attains the absolute minimum of a(n) only in the case when {a(n)-3, a(n)-1} are twin primes, or does not attain it at all. Therefore, if there is only a finite number of twin primes, we have a contradiction. Thus the above condition is sufficient for infinity of twin primes.",
        "Note also that, if there is only a finite number of twin primes, then after the last pair of them, this sequence will coincide with A242720. Then, in order to avoid a contradiction (again according to the Shevelev link), we should accept that there exits a number N_0 such that, for every n >= N_0, the following inequality holds: max(A242719(n),A242720(n)) > (min(A242719(n),A242720(n)))^2. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 24 2014",
        "It is easy to prove that min(A242719(n), A242720(n)) >= prime(n)^2+1, while we conjecture that max(A242719(n),A242720(n))<= prime(n)^4. Thus this conjecture implies there are infinitely many twin primes. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jun 01 2014"
