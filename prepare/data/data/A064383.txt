        "If a is in the sequence, then so are all its positive divisors. If a and b are coprime and in the sequence, then so is their product. Hence in extending the sequence, one may as well just look for primes in the sequence (and then check powers of these primes). Heuristically one might expect a very sparse but infinite set of primes in the sequence, but the largest one I know is p=463 and I've searched up to 600000. This sequence was brought to my attention by David Loeffler.",
