        "Since a(n) and a(n)+8 are consecutive primes either a(n)+7 or a(n)+1 is a multiple of 100; in addition a(n) must have the form 6k-1. Therefore, every century spanned by a(n) and a(n)+8 is a multiple of 300. It appears that every multiple of 3 occurs as the difference round((a(n+1)-a(n))/100); all multiples of 3 through 432 occur as these differences for a(n) < 1000000000."
