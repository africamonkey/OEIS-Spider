        "Let p = (p(1),...,p(n)) be a permutation such that p(k) = n + 1 - p(n+1-k) for all 1 <= k <= n.",
        "Then 2-set {k, n+1-k} (i.e., where the sum of elements is n+1) is mapped by p into {p(k), p(n+1-k)} with the same property p(k) + p(n+1-k) = n+1. Therefore every such permutation induces a permutation q on the 2-sets {k, n+1-k}, and for odd n has a fixed point p((n+1)/2) = (n+1)/2.",
        "Furthermore, it is easy to see that if p is self-inverse then so is q.",
        "Let s=floor(n/2). For every permutation q on the sets {k, n+1-k}, 1 <= k <= s, let's count how many p induce it.",
        "It is clear that if q has exactly m fixed points (and so the other s-m 2-sets form pairs of inverses under q), then there exist 2^m ways to define p on the fixed points of q and 2^((s-m)/2) ways to define p on the remaining elements.",
        "Hence the total number of permutations p inducing q is 2^m * 2^((s-m)/2) = 2^((s+m)/2). The number of permutations q on s elements with exactly m fixed points is nonzero only if m and s are of the same oddness and in this case it is binomial(s,m) * (s-m)! / 2^((s-m)/2) / ((s-m)/2)! = binomial(s,m) * (s-m-1)!! = s! / m! / 2^((s-m)/2) / ((s-m)/2)!.",

Let s-m=2t so that m=s-2t and a(n) = Sum_{t=0..floor(s/2)} s! * 2^(s-2t) / ((s-2t)! * t!) = s! * [x^s] e^(2x) * e^(x^2) = s! * [x^s] e^(x^2+2x) = A000898(s), according to its e.g.f. QED",
