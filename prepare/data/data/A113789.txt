        "3-almost prime analog of A056809 (numbers n such that n, n+1 and n+2 are products of two primes). This sequence consists of the least of 3 consecutive 3-almost primes, or 4 or more consecutive 3-almost primes (i.e. n, n+1 and n+2 but not excluding n+3 also 3-almost prime). A067813 has some runs of up to 7 consecutive 3-almost primes (i.e. starting 211673). But there cannot be 8 consecutive 3-almost primes, as every run of 8 consecutive positive integers contains exactly one multiple of 8 = 2^3 and only 8 of all positive multiples of 8 is a 3-almost prime (i.e., all larger multiples have at least 4 prime factors, with multiplicity)."
