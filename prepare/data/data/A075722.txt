        "For s = 5,8,11,14,17,20,..., n_s=1+n+n^s is always composite for any n>1. Also at n=1, n_s=3 is a prime for any s. So it is interesting to consider only the cases of s != 5,8,11,14,17,20,... and n>1. Here I consider the case s=7 and find several first n's making n_s a prime (or a probable prime)."
