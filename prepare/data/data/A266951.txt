        "Goldbach conjecture related. The values of A266948(n) range theoretically between 2 and n. The smaller they are, the easier it was to find a suitable twin prime, and thus the more likely the conjecture \"A266948(n) > 0 for all n > 1\" holds. These record values vs. the respective indices A266950 yield an estimate for the growth of an upper bound."
