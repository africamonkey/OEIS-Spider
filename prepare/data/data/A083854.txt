        "It is simple to divide equilateral triangles into these numbers of congruent parts: squares by making smaller equilateral triangles; 6*squares by diving each small equilateral triangles by its medians into small right-angled triangles; and 2*squares or 3*squares by recombining three or two of these small right-angled triangles."
