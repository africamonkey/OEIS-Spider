    "comment": [
        "Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions and GRH suggest that average gaps between primes of the form 4k + 3 below x are about phi(4)*log(x). This sequence shows that the record gap ending at p grows almost as fast as phi(4)*log^2(p). Here phi(n) is A000010, Euler's totient function; phi(4)=2.",
