Here, the size of the terms roughly doubles over the interval of very few indices. The indices such that a(n[k]) >= 2*a(n[k-1]) are n[k] = 3, 5, 9, 17, 30, 46, 69, 89, ... .",
        "This sequence first differs from A003278 at the 21st term, which is 92 here but 91 in A003278. Up to 91, each natural number n that did not appear in this sequence failed to do so because there were two smaller numbers n-a and n-2a, with A229037(n-a) and A229037(n-2a) both equal to 1. 91 is missing from this sequence; in other words, A229037(91) is not 1, because A229037(27) = 9 and A229037(59) = 5. - _Jack W Grahl_, Dec 28 2014"
