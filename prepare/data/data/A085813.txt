        "The probability that there are at most k different cards in t drawings is (k/m)^t * m_over_k, where m_over_k means the binomial-coefficient m!/(k!*(m-k)!). This contains also the cases with k-1 different cards, which we want to subtract. Inclusion and exclusion leads to the formula Sum[k=1..m; (-1)^(m-k) (k/m)^t * m_over_k]."

        "a(6)=27 because you have to roll a die 27 times to see all 6 possible outcomes with a probability over 0.95. (If you roll a die 27 times the probability to get all 6 sides at least once is 0,95658638... . If you roll the die only 26 times, the probability is 0,94798274... .)"
