        "These are the primes that are found in the k=9 case of the family of sequences whose k=1 case is the Fibonacci sequence A000045, k=2 case is the Padovan sequence A000931 (offset so as to begin 1,1,1), k=3 case is A079398 (offset so as to begin 1,1,1,1), k=4 case is A103372, k=5 case is A103373, k=6 case is A103374, k=7 case is A103375 and k=8 case is A103376. The general case for integer k>1 is defined: a(1) = a(2) = ... = a(k+1)= 1 and for n>(k+1) a(n) = a(n-k) + a(n-[k+1]). For this k=9 case, the ratio of successive terms a(n)/a(n-1) approaches the unique positive root of the characteristic polynomial: x^10 - x - 1 = 0. This is the real constant (to 111 digits accuracy): 1.07576606608683715805959952416527582069253024763920327947706839454447262695858216193361644562437707487646342884 This sequence of prime values in this k=9 case is A103387; The sequence of semiprime values in this k=9 case is A103397."
