        "Numbers n such that the partition B(n) has only prime parts. For n>=2, B(n) is defined as the partition obtained by taking the prime decomposition of n and replacing each prime factor p by its index i (i.e. i-th prime = p); also B(1) = the empty partition. For example, B(350) = B(2*5^2*7) = [1,3,3,4]. B is a bijection between the positive integers and the set of all partitions. In the Maple program the command B(n) yields B(n). - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 09 2015",
