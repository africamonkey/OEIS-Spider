        "As pointed out by Chris Thompson on the SeqFan List, the terms of the sequence are of the form q+1, where p/q are increasingly better approximations of log_10(Pi), and apparently (for all known terms*) convergents of the continued fraction. At least this easily yields upper bounds for the terms. [*not true for n=13, 16, 27, 39, ...] - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 31 2017"
