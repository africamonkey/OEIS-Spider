        "This is the 3-almost prime analog of A063989 \"numbers with a prime number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity)\" and A110893 \"numbers with a semiprime number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity).\" Below 4096, this is identical to 8-almost primes (A014613). Between 4096 and 6144, this is identical to 8-almost primes. Below 262144 this is identical to the union of 8-almost primes (A014613) and 12-almost primes (A069273). Between 262144 and 393216, this is identical to the union of 8-almost primes and 12-almost primes."
