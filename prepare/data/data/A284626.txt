        "From _Michel Dekking_, Aug 26 2017: (Start)",
        "Proof of the conjecture. Let x = A010060 be the Thue Morse sequence, and let y = A284622 be the [0011->0]-transform of x. Let a = A284626 be the positions of 1 in y. There are 3 steps in the proof.",
        "Step 1. It is easily verified that a(n)/n -> 9/4 if and only if f(1,a) = 4/9, where in general f(w,z) denotes the frequency of a word w in the infinite sequence z, if it exists.",
        "Step 2. One has f(0011,x) = 1/12. It is well-known that the frequencies of words in any fixed point of a primitive morphism exist. This is usually proved by Perron-Frobenius theory. For a quick proof see the paper \"On the Thue-Morse measure\".",
        "Step 3. Let k(n) be the number of 1's in x(1)...x(n), and m(n) the number of 0011's in x(1)...x(n). Then the number of 1's in y(1)...y(n-3m(n)) is equal to k(n)-2m(n). But we know by Step 2 that m(n)/n -> 1/12, and obviously k(n)/n -> 1/2. So f(1,y) is equal to ((1/2 - 2/12)/(1 - 3/12) = 4/9. (End)"
