    "name": "Number of different two-dimensional burst patterns in the grid graph with eight neighbors: The grid graph with eight neighbors has Z^2 as vertices and each vertex (x,y) is connected to (x-1,y),(x+1,y),(x,y-1),(x,y+1),(x-1,y-1),(x+1,y+1),(x-1,y+1),(x+1,y-1). A cluster of size t is a set of t points such that each pair of points of the set is on a connected path contained entirely within the set. A burst pattern is a labeling of Z^2 with 0's and 1's. The term a(n) denotes the number of different (up to a translation) burst patterns whose 1's are covered by a cluster of size n.",
