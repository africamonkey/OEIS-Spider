        "For n >= 1, a(n) >= A056830(n), the least n-digit positive integer with no identical adjacent digits (also the least positive integer whose digits occur in n runs). Conjecture: For all n, a(n) <> 0.",
        "If the conjecture is true, then this sequence and the following two sequences are equivalent: i) Smallest prime with exactly n runs of digits and ii) Smallest prime with at least n runs of digits. For each n <= 625, a(n) is an n-digit prime (provided that each probable prime shown in the link is indeed a prime -- or at least one of very many (slightly) larger probable prime candidates is prime).",
        "As each a(n) shown is very near A056830(n), I believe it is extremely unlikely that a randomly-given n would yield a 0 term (but I don't have a proof for arbitrary n)."

Also each digit, 1, 0, 1, 3, occurs in a run of identical digits of length 1 for a total of 4 runs with 1013 being the smallest prime of any length with 4 runs of digits."
