        "If one considers rotations in the complex plane the complex number i can be thought of as a rotation by 90 degrees counterclockwise. This also corresponds to half of pi. If one raises the number e (2.718...) to the angle in question, (that angle corresponding to the complex number i, or half of pi), the result is an number 4.81047738... which can be thought of as corresponding (but not being equivalent to) the complex number, i.",
        "The next 90 degree sweep, which corresponds to i^2, is 23.1406... and is the known constant, e^pi. Continuing around the circle, we find the numbers i^3 = 111.31..., i^4 = 535.4... etc. Truncating these numbers to integers yields the series, 0, 4, 23, 111, etc. I came across this sequence as I tried to find a real number that corresponded to the complex number 'i' in the complex plane."
