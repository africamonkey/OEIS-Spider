        "A word w is \"semiperiodic\" if R(w) < H(w), where R(w) is the smallest natural number such that there is no right special factor of length n.  A factor is a contiguous block occurring within w.  A factor f is right special if fa and fb both appear in w for some a not equal to b.  H(w) is the length of the shortest prefix of w which appears only once in w.",
        "Alternatively, a word w is semiperiodic if the length of its shortest period is <= |w| - R(w)."
