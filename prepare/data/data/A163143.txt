        "We call these numbers \"zipper numbers\", because the factorization resembles a zipper both graphically and the way one would go about summing the digits.",
        "Zipper numbers are similar to vampire numbers, that is, there can be many ways to factor a number as a product of powers i.e.: 36=6^2, but one has to find the correct way, i.e., that that will yield the same digit sum. Obviously, some restrictions must be made, such as: the use of x^0 and 1^x is forbidden. Note that 8=4^1*2^1, 27=3^2*3^1 and 44=11^1*4^1 are not prime factorizations.",
        "The consecutive numbers 25,26,27 can be called triple zippers or trip-zips... How many more are there...? Prime numbers and powers of 10 can never be zippers.",
