        "Proof : A004215 lists numbers of the form 4^i*(8*j+7) where i,j >= 0. So numbers of the form 8*j+7 is always in A004215 for i = 0, j >= 0. Since (10^n - 1)/9 - 7 = (10^n - 2^6)/9 = (2^n*5^n - 2^6)/9 = 2^3*(2^(n-3)*5^n - 2^3)/9, (10^n - 1)/9 - 7 is always divisible by 2^3 for n > 2, that means (10^n - 1)/9 is number of the form 8*j + 7 for n > 2. Trivially, (10^n - 1)/9 is always a palindrome for positive n, that is (10^n - 1)/9 is member of this sequence for all n > 2."
