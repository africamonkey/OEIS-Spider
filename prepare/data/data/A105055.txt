    "comment": [
        "For many n, a(n) = 2^k, where k = floor(log_2(A001405(n))). For n from 9 through 40, k = n-3, but it is smaller thereafter; no formula of the form k = n-c will work for sufficiently large n. There are infinitely many exceptions to this formula, since a(2^m-1) is always odd, hence not equal to 2^k for m > 1. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Mar 29 2014, replacing assertions by the author."
