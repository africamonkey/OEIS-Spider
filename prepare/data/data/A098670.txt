        "The sequence goes 5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 220, 221, ..., 290, 2222, 22222, 222222, ... for 275 more digits, then for most of the rest of the sequence, a(n+1)=a(n)+1. Starting with a(1)=3 yields 3, 4, 22, 23, ..., 30, 32, 222, 2222, 2223,... for at least 2000 more digits. (The 222nd digit happens to be the initial digit of a(63)=2271.) Starting with a(1)=4 yields 4, 5, 6, 22, 23, ..., 30, 222, 2222, 2223, ... See A210416 for a variant without requirement of growth. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 08 2013"
