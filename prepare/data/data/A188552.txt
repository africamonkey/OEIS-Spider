        "The link gives an illustration with three figures: Figure 1 contains the prime numbers at locations of angle turns in a pentagonal spiral; Figure 2 contains the prime numbers in a pentagonal spiral; Figure 3 shows a variety of sequences that are associated with the numbers of the lines and diagonals in the pentagonal spiral. For example, the sequence A033537 given by the formula n(2n+5) generates the sequence {0, 7, 18, 33, 52, 75, ... } and the corresponding line in the spiral is { 7, 18, 33, 52, 75, ... }."
