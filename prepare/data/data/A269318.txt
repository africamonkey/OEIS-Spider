        "The number of unramified cyclic extensions N|K of relative degree p of a quadratic field K with p-class rank r (p an odd prime) is given by the multiplicity formula m=(p^r-1)/(p-1) [Mayer, Theorem 3.1]. Here, we have p=3, r=2, and thus m=4. Consequently, the terms of A269318 characterize all quartets (L_1,...L_4) of pairwise non-isomorphic non-Galois cubic fields sharing a common fundamental discriminant d(L_i)=d(K). There occur 5 of these quartets in [Angell] (up to 10^5), 61 in [Ennola, Turunen] (up to 5*10^5), and 2870 in [Llorente, Quer] (up to 10^7). The number 2879 in the first and third line below Table 4 [Llorente, Quer] is erroneous, since the 9 quartets in Table 6 [Llorente, Quer] are ramified and satisfy d(L_i)=f^2*d(K) with various conductors f>1. (We point out misprints in the caption and in the header of Table 6 [Llorente, Quer], where our Fuehrer f is denoted by T and should correctly be given by 3^m*T_0.) The most recent and most extensive computation is due to [Bush]. He found 481756 unramified quartets up to 10^9, which are obviously very sparse with absolute density~0.05%. The density~0.16% with respect to the asymptotic number (3/pi^2)*10^9~303963551 of all positive fundamental discriminants is slightly bigger. Compare the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics [Cohen, Martinet]."

        "The execution of the MAGMA program yields the 161 leading terms of A269318 up to 10^6 and requires 9200 seconds on a single thread of an Intel i7 4-core processor with clock frequency 4GHz. The computation is slow because 303957 discriminants have to be checked for the structure of their associated 3-class groups. Among the 161 3-class groups of 3-rank 2, there are 149 of type (3,3) and 12 of type (9,3). Parallelization (for instance, 4 threads processing ranges of length 250000) would reduce the CPU-time."
