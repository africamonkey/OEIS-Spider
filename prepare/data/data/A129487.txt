        "The unitary deficient numbers account for almost 93% of all integers (including all primes (A000040) and prime powers (A000961)) and asymptotically satisfy a(n)~1.0753n. This provides an excellent fit as n grows larger. For example, the one millionth unitary deficient number is 1075293 and the asserted approximation returns 1075300, giving an error of only 0.00065%."
