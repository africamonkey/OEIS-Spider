        "The following lists the types of numbers which appear (p,q are distinct primes, congruences are mod 20 and the number in square brackets gives the number of irreducible elements of that norm counting a and -a only once): 4 [1]; 5 [1]; p==1,9 [2]; p^2 where p==-1,-3,-7,-9 [1]; 2p where p==3,7 [2]; p^2 where p==3,7 [3]; pq where p,q==3,7 [4]."
