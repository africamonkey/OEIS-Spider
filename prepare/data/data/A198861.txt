        "Let G, the group of rotations in 3 dimensional space act on the set of n! paintings of each Platonic solid having n faces. There are n! fixed points in the action table since the only element in G that leaves a painting fixed is the identity element. The order of G is A098427/2. So by Burnside's Lemma a(n)=n!/|G|."
