    "comment": [
        "The idea for the sequence came from how long DNA sequences are produced from only four bases, namely, A,T,G,C. Nature is able to produce remarkable species on Earth by permuting these four bases in an apparent random order. The connection between arrangement of DNA bases in the chromosomes of species and number system is poorly understood."
