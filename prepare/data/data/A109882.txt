        "How is this sequence obtained from the given formula? What values for k are used? In particular, how are the terms a(1)-a(10) obtained using this formula? Using an inner loop for m and an outer loop for k, starting at m=1 and k=1, one obtains the infinite subsequence starting 11, 22, 33, 44, .... - _Felix Fr\u00f6hlich_, Jul 26 2014",
