Permutations of digits (x1,...,xr) are different numbers n with the same property S(n)=PI(n). For example: x1*x2 = x1 + x2; this equation has only 1 solution (2,2) which, gives the number 22. x1*x2*x3 = x1 + x2 + x3 has a solution (1,2,3), so numbers the 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321 have the property. - _Ctibor O.
