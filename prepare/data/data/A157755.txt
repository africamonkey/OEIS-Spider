        "From table in Kontorovich, version 2, 2005, page 7. Abstract: \"The prime number theorem gives the following asymptotic for the n-th prime: p_n ~ iL(n), where we are calling iL the inverse to the logarithmic integral function, Li. Let pi(x) denote the number of primes p <= x with p=[iL(n)] for some n. We say that these primes hit the value suggested by the prime number theorem \"on the nose\". Using exponential sums, the method of stationary phase, and Vaughan-type identities, we show that pi(x) ~ x/log^2(x) and interpret this fact as the independence of the process of the primes to their average value, iL.\"",
