        "The series giving the best rational approximations to 1/e is 1/e = 1/3 + 2/a(1) - 2/a(2) + 2/a(3) - ... The continued fraction for 1/e is [0;2,1, 2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,1,8...] and the above best approximations give every third convergent, the convergents deriving from [0;2,1], [0;2,1,2, 1,1], [0;2,1,2,1,1,4,1,1] and so forth are the partial sums of the above infinite series."
