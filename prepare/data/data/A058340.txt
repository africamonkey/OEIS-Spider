        "Proof of conjecture: q'=(q-1)/2 is an odd prime > 3.  If phi(x)=2q', which has 2-adic order 1 but is not a power of 2, there must be exactly one odd prime r dividing x.  We could also have a factor of 2 (but no higher power, which would contribute more 2's to phi(x)).  If x = r^e or 2r^e, then phi(x) = (r-1) r^(e-1).  For this to be 2q' one possibility is r-1 = 2 and r^(e-1)=q', but then q'=r=3, ruled out by q > 7.  The only other possibility is r-1=2q' and e=1, which makes r=q and x=q or 2q. - _Robert Israel_, Jan 04 2017",
