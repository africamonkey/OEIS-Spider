        "Suppose that p = x(1) >= x(2) >= \u2026 >= x(k) is a partition of n.  Let y(1) > y(2) > \u2026 > y(h) be the distinct parts of p, and let m(i) be the multiplicity of y(i) for 1 <= i <= h.  Then we can \"look\" at p as \"m(1) y(1)'s and m(2) y(2)'s and \u2026 m(h) y(h)'s\". Reversing the m's and y's, we can then \"say\" the Look-and-Say partition of p, denoted by LS(p).  The name \"Look-and-Say\" follows the example of Look-and-Say integer sequences (e.g., A005150).  As p ranges through the partitions of n, LS(p) ranges through all the Look-and-Say partitions of n. The number of these is A239455(n).",
        "The Look-and-Say array is distinct from the Wilf array, described at A098859; for example, the number of Look-and-Say partitions of 9 is A239455(9) = 16, whereas the number of Wilf partitions of 9 is A098859(9) = 15.  The Look-and-Say partition of 9 which is not a Wilf partitions of 9 is [2,2,2,1,1,1]."
