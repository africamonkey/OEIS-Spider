        "Suppose that u and v are positive real numbers for which the sets S(u)={ju} and S(v)={kv}, for j>=1 and k>=1, are disjoint.  Let a(n) be the position of nu when the numbers in S(u) and S(v) are jointly ranked.  Then, as is easy to prove, a is the Beatty sequence of the number r=1+u/v, and the complement of a is the Beatty sequence of s=1+v/u.  For A182760, take u = golden ratio = (1+sqrt(5))/2 and v=sqrt(5), so that r=(3+5^(-1/2))/2 and s=(7-5^(-1/2)/2."
