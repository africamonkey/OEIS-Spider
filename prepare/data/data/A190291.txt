    "comment": [
        "The intervals [u,v] in the weak order that are distributive lattices are characterized by Stembridge. They are the intervals such that u^{-1}.v is fully commutative, i.e. avoids the pattern 321."

        "Example: for n=3 there are six 1-element intervals, six 2-element intervals, and four intervals that are 3-element chains, for a total of 16."
