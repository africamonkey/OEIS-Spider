        "Note this splits the chain of decimal digits right in front of the period 142857, which means the least significant digits of t may be some of the least significant digits of 142857. We may assume that 1/(7*10^c) < 1/10^b, so c>=b.",
        "Multiply by a(n)*7*10^c to get 7*10^c = a(n)*(7*t*10^(c-b)+1). Reduction modulo 7 shows that a(n)=7*k, so 10^c = k*(7*t*10^(c-b)+1).",
        "Decomposition of both sides into prime factors shows that k must be of the form 2^i*5^j, which shows that the a(n) are of the form 7*A003592(.)",
        "To demonstrate that none of the A003592 are missed it remains to show that the other factor, 7*t*10^(c-b)+1, can always be chosen of the form 2^(i')*5^(i'+i-j) to cancel the excess of the two exponents that the prime factorization of k may have: 10^c =2^c*5^c demands equal exponents.",
        "Because t and 10^(c-b) can chosen freely, this is equivalent to showing that there is always a t, a c-b and an i' such that 7*t*10^(c-b)+1 = 10^i'*(excess power of 2 or 5).",
        "On the right hand side, the (power of 2 or 5) mod 7 is a fixed number between 1 and 6.",
        "As i' runs through 7 consecutive numbers, 10^i' mod 7 attains all numbers between 1 and 6; the product 10^i'*(power of 2 or 5) can always be tuned to == 1 (mod 7) by selection of i', and t*10^(c-b) follows by division. This shows that all k of the form 2^i*5^j contribute to the sequence.] (End)"
