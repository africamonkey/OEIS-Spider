        "For all m>=a(n) there are at least n primes between m and 2m exclusively. This calculation relies on the fact that pi(2m)-pi(m) > m/(3*log(m)) for m>=5. This is one more than the terms of A084139 with offset changed from 0 to 1.",
        "For n > 5889, pi(2n) - pi(n) > f(2, 2n) - f(3, n) where f(k, x) = x/log x * (1 + 1/log x + k/(log x)^2). This may be useful for checking larger terms. The constant 3 can be improved at the cost of an increase in the constant 5889. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 02 2012",

Proof: By the minimality of R_n, the interval ((p_k)/2,p_k] contains exactly n primes, so p_(k-n) < (p_k)/2. - Copied and adapted from a comment by _Jonathan Sondow_ in A168421 by _John W.
