        "The tetrahedron may be aligned with the Cartesian axes by putting its triangular basis on the horizontal plane, with four vertices at (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0), (n, 0, 0),  (n/2, sqrt(3)*n/2, 0) and (n/2, n/(2*sqrt(3)), n*sqrt(2/3)) see A194082, A020769, A157697.",
        "The volume of tetrahedron is a third times the area of the base triangle times height, (1/3) * (sqrt(3)*n^2/4) * n*sqrt(2/3) = n^3/(3*2^(2/3) = A020829*n^3. This defines an obvious upper limit of floor(n^3/sqrt(72)) = A171973(n) of placing unit cubes into this tetrahedron.",
        "Regular packing: We place the first layer of unit cubes so they touch the floor of the tetrahedron. Their number is limited by the area of the triangular horizontal section of the plane z=1 inside the tetrahedron, which touches all of them; this isosceles horizontal triangle has edge length E(n,z) = n-z*sqrt(3/2). This edge length is a linear interpolation for triangular horizontal cuts between z=0 at the bottom and the summit of the tetrahedron at z=n*sqrt(2/3).",
        "This first layer confined by a triangle characterized by E(n,z) may host RegSquInTri(E) := sum_{y=1..floor(E*sqrt(3)/2)} floor(E-y*2/sqrt(3)) cubes, following recursively the same regular placement and counting strategy as for squares in isosceles triangles, see A194082.",
        "The number of unit cubes in the next layer, between z=1 and z=2, is limited by the area of the horizontal section of the triangle z=2 inside the tetrahedron, where the triangle has edge length n-z*sqrt(3/2).",
        "So in layer z=1, 2, ... we insert ReqSquInTri(E(n,z)) cubes. a(n) is the sum over all these layers with z limited by the z-value of the vertex at the summit.",
        "There is a generalization to placing unit cubes of higher dimensions into higher dimensional tetrahedra.",
        "The growth is expected to be roughly equal to the growth of A000292."
