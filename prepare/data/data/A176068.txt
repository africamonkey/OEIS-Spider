        "From Table 1: Hermitian self-dual codes, p.2 of Harada. The main aim of this note [paper by Harada] is to give a complete classification of Hermitian self-dual codes of length 20. Theorem 1. There are 3427 inequivalent Hermitian self-dual codes of length 20. Of these two are extremal, 999 have minimum weight 6, 2181 have minimum weight 4, and 245 have minimum weight 2. All computer calculations in this note were done by MAGMA."
