    "comment": [
        "Think of binary n as a string S of 0's and 1's. By a \"run\" of 0's or 1's, it is meant either a substring all of contiguous 0's, each run bounded by 1's or the edge of S; or a substring all of contiguous 1's, each run bounded by 0's or the edge of S."

        "451 in binary is 111000011. This contains a run of three 1's, followed by a run of four 0's, followed by a run of two 1's. Since (3,4,2) is a permutation of some number of consecutive positive integers (2,3,4), then 451 is in the sequence."
