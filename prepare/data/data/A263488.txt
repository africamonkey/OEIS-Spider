        "For each n, a proof of the existence or nonexistence of such a representation can be constructed effectively, by building a finite-state transducer that multiplies by n, and then searching for a path in the corresponding directed graph whose inputs and outputs are labeled only with 0's and 1's. This was used to show, for example, that 529, 592, 601, 616, 5368, and 50281 have no such representation.",
        "It is not hard to show that every element of this sequence lies in an interval bounded by (2/3)*3^n and (3/2)*3^n for some n >= 0. However, not all elements of these intervals have a representation.",
        "It is also not hard to see that if the last nonzero digit of n in base 3 is a 2, then n is not an element of the sequence.",
