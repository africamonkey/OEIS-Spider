        "Consider a set of n labeled elements. Form all splittings into two subsets. Consider the resulting sets and perform the splittings on all their subsets and so on. a(n+1) = number of splittings of the n-set {1,2,3,...,n}.",
        "E.g. a(4) = 7 because we have {abc}, {ab}{c}, {ac}{b}, {bc}{a}, {{a}{b}}{c}, {{a}{c}}{b}, {{b}{c}}{a}. The case for unlabeled elements is described by A137732. This structure is related to the Double Factorials A000142 for which the recurrence is a(n) = sum(C(n-1,k) *a(k) *a(n-k), k=1..n-1) with a(1)=1, a(2)=1.",
