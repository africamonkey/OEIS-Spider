        "Based on the 10000-term b-file for A214551. But since little is known about A214551, the values beyond 7 are conjectural. For instance, it is only a conjecture that 8 and 10 do not appear in A214551.",
        "Based on the first 10^5 terms of A214551 these conjectured values are correct; it seems that there only 1, 4, 8, 25, 29, 33 and 45 occur more than once. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jul 24 2012"
