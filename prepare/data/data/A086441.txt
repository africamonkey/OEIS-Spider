        "This uses a too broad notion of equivalence. Besides the obvious reflection in a plane perpendicular to the straight line, if the end of the curve is in a free region of the plane, it is extended to infinity and the direction of the curve can then be reversed. A000560 uses a better definition of equivalence."
