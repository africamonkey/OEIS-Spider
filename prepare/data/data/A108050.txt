        "There cannot be any primes of this form when n is even, because all such numbers must be divisible by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its odd digits and the sum of its even digits is 0 or divisible by 11. When n is even, the difference is always 0. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Jul 12 2008",
