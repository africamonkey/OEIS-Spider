        "Sequence A033014 consists of the numbers that have all base 16 digits repeated *exactly* twice. (This is equivalent to say that the base-256 digits are 0x00, 0x11, 0x22,... or 0xFF, in hex notation, and no two adjacent base-256 digits are equal.) Thus, these numbers are divisible by 0x11 = 17, and the result of the division is a number which has no other base-256 digits than 0x00, 0x01,... or 0x0F, and no two adjacent digits equal. Conversely, it is clear that exactly these numbers are terms of A033014 when multiplied by 17 = 0x11. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 05 2014"
