    "comment": [
        "The only consecutive brilliant numbers are {9, 10} and {14, 15}; and for n > 14 there are no brilliant constellations of the form {n, n+(2k+1)} or equivalently {n, 2k+n+1} with k >= 0. Proof: One of n and 2k+n+1 will be even. And there are no even brilliant numbers > 14 since they must have the form 2*p where p is a prime having only one digit."
