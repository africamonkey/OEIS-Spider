        "Number of inequivalent (under the group of permutations and \"inversion of variables\") monotone Boolean functions of n of fewer variables.",
        "Given f, a function of n variables, we define the \"inversion of variables\", i, by (i.f)(x1,...,xn)=1+f(1+x1,...,1+xn) (we can write (i.f)(x)=1+f(1+x) where the second \"1\" denotes (1,...,1)). It turns out that if f is monotone, then i.f is also monotone. On the other hand, a permutation of n elements, p, acts on f by (p.f)(x)=f(p(x)). It turns out that if f is monotone, then p.f is also monotone. We define p.i by (p.i)(f)=p.(i.f) and i.p by (i.p)(f)=i.(p.f). If we define a.b by (a.b).f=a.(b.f) for a,b elements of G, it turns out that G={p.i,p: p is a permutation of n elements} is a group. In this context, f and g are equivalent if there exists b (an element of G) such that b.f=g."
