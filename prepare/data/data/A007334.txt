        "This sequence was obtained using the deletion-contraction recursions satisfied by the number of spanning trees for graphs. It is readily seen that the number of spanning trees in K_{n}-e (the complete graph K_{n} with an edge e deleted) is (n-2)*(n^{n-3}). Since the number of spanning trees in K_{n} is n^{n-2}, we see that (n-2)*(n^{n-3})+f(n)=n^{n-2} by the deletion-contraction recursion. Hence it follows that f(n)=2*n^{n-3}. - N. Eaton, W. Kook and L. Thoma (andrewk(AT)math.uri.edu), Jan 17 2004",
