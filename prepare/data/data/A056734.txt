    "comment": [
        "Using empirical data for 1 <= n <= 10000, it has been found that the distribution of these terms correlates well (R^2 = 0.9513) to f(n) = a*n^(1/2) with 'a' a constant approximately 0.73. In addition, f'(n) approximates the probability that any particular n has this property. Any terms in A056154 must also satisfy this sequence."
