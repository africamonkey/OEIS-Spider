        "There are a total of 657 distinct terms, the last of which is 99066^2=9814072356. The highest power occurs in 2^29. There are 609 squares, 39 cubes, 19 fourth powers, 9 fifth powers, 4 sixth powers, 4 seventh powers, 3 eighth powers, 2 ninth powers, 2 tenth powers and one each of powers 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 and 29. These counts to not add to 657 because 1 is not counted and some powers, such as 2^4 = 4^2 = 16, are counted twice. - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 09 2005"
