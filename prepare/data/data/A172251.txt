        "Wieb Bosma, p.10: Following the bounds given in the proof of Theorem 1.6, computational evidence suggests that... a proof of the above identity using the techniques of Bhargava and Hanke developed in the proof of the 290-Theorem may require a careful analysis of a possible Siegel zero. The sequence given is thus conjectured to be complete as shown."
