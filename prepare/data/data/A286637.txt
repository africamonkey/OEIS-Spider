    "comment": [
        "An automedian triangle has the square of its sides in an arithmetic progression. Hence its sides (a, b, c) with a <= b <= c are related by a^2+c^2 = 2b^2. Also a+b > c in order to satisfy the triangle inequality. It is so named because its sides and medians are proportional to each other but in a different order. Apart from the unit equilateral triangle all other primitive integer automedian triangles can be generated from primitive Pythagorean triangles (PPT's). If x^2+y^2 = z^2 is a PPT then a = |x-y|, b = z and c = x+y gives an integer automedian triangle (a, b, c) provided that Min(2x, 2y) < z. Note that the PPT (3, 4, 5) will not generate an integer automedian triangle."
