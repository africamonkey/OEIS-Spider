        "With 'asymmetric' is meant almost palindromic with a 'core' (pseudo-palindromic). The core '09' when transformed into '1n' (n=-1) makes the base number palindromic. E.g. 1109111 is in fact 11_09_111 -> 11_(10-1)_111 -> 11_1n_111 -> 111n111 and palindromic. Similarly core 099 becomes 10n, core 0999 becomes 100n, etc."
