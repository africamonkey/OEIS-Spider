        "This sequence is similar to various sequences with rows of coins (often pennies). Each brick must be offset by 1/2 brick from any bricks under it. However, a brick might only have a brick under one half, provided the pile is stable. A definition of stability is provided in the Paterson paper.",
        "Since the main goal of the Paterson paper is the search for stable piles with maximum overhang (and not to find the number of stable piles), it is likely that some stable piles configurations not leading to significant overhangs have been passed over. So it is not easy to determine whether or not all the stable piles configurations have been accounted for! So even though I added graphic depictions for n=8 and n=9 (cf. A168368a), I will abstain for now from appending a(8) and a(9) to this sequence until it has been ascertained that none are missing (please verify A168368a).",
        "Connected piles only (allowing piles with disconnected subpiles would produce a different sequence).",
        "For this sequence I assumed that the bricks on any given row need not be contiguous. A different sequence would be produced if we required the bricks on any given row to be contiguous (fewer piles of bricks since the piles would constitute a subset of the ones obtained from the current piles).",
        "a(0) is set to 0 (no pile) instead of 1 (empty pile) since the number a(n) of stable connected piles of n bricks with height <= 2 is F_n (n-th Fibonacci number) and at least 4 bricks are needed to make a stable connected pile of height greater than 2 and outgrow the Fibonacci sequence {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...}.",
        "The number of stable connected piles of n bricks is T_n (n-th tribonacci numbers, with a(0)=0, a(1)=a(2)=1, T_n = {0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, ...}) up to n=5, after which it falls behind (for n >= 6).",
