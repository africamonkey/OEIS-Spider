        "The ratio d(n) = a(n)/n, while obviously bounded, has no limit. Rather, it kind of 'oscillates', at an exponentially decreasing rate, between about 1/3 and 2/3. As mentioned by Jeffreys, the values of liminf and limsup of the set {d(n)} are 1/3 and 2/3, respectively. A proof of this fact by elementary means is relatively easy, for example using the first formula below, but the following statement is a conjecture: Any real value c comprised in the interval [1/3,2/3] is an accumulation point of {d(n)}."
