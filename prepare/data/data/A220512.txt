        "This is a toothpick sequence of forking paths to 135 degrees. The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage. A221565 (the first differences) give the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage. It appears that the structure has a fractal (or like-fractal) behavior. For more information see A194700.",
