        "Let c(n) be the number of strict partitions (that is, every part has multiplicity 1) of 2n having 1 more even part than odd, so that there is an ordering of parts for which the even and odd parts alternate and the first and last terms are even.  This sequence is nondecreasing, unlike A239871, of which it is a bisection; the other bisection is A239873."
