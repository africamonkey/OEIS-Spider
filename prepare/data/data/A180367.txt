        "Commutator of Primes and Lucas numbers. Some subtlety in indexing -- should we start with 0th Lucas number is 2, and 0th prime is 1? As shown here, I use \"first\" to mean the initial value as shown in P(n) and L(n), even though their indexing differs. This is to A093062 Fibonacci(prime(i))-prime(Fibonacci(i)) as Fibonacci is to Lucas."
