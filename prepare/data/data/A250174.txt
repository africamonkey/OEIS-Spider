        "n = 9069 * 2^64163 + 1 is an example of a rather large member of this sequence. The generated 115914 decimal digit prime is proved by the N-1 method (because n is prime and n*(n-1) is fully factored and this provides for an exactly 33.33...% factorization for Phi_14(n) - 1). - _Serge Batalov_, Mar 13 2015"
