    "name": "a(n) is the maximum possible length of a sequence consisting of integers [0..n-1] such that no two nonempty adjacent segments of the same length have the same sum modulo n.",
    "comment": [
        "The original source for this sequence was the problem 'perlbrac' in the 2009 USACO Holiday Contest (http://ace.delos.com/HOL09) which asked contestants to find the longest sequences of this type that they possibly could. a(n) is the upper bound on the length of such a sequence for a given n."
    ],
    "example": [
        "For example, in the sequence 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2 (length 7) consisting of integers in the range [0..2], no two adjacent segments of equal length (e.g. 0, 1, 2 and 1, 0, 1) have the same sum modulo 3. There is also no longer sequence with this property, hence a(3) = 7."
