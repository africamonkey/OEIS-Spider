In fact, if all names of multiples of a million are considered to end with an \"n\" (even beyond the usual naming system: see A146755 for links), those numbers are terms of A060228, not this sequence, meaning this sequence is precisely {positive multiples of 100} MINUS {(positive) multiples of 1000000}."
