        "The numbers 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, and 41 above are the only numbers B such that m^2+m+B is prime for m=0,....,B-2 (this can be proved, see Mollin's paper and is closely related to the celebrated Rabinowitsch criterion).",
        "Since the value of m^2+m+B is B^2 for m=B-1, one cannot possible do better than this.",
        "An obvious question of course is whether for given n, a(n) exists at all. This is far from obvious. Assuming the generally believed k-tuplets conjecture the answer is yes as was shown by Andrew Granville. For a proof (which is not very difficult) see the paper by Mollin.",
        "It is also known, due to work of Lukes, Patterson and Williams that any further elements in the above sequence, if they exist, are >10^18.",
