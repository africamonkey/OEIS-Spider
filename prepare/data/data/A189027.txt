        "These terms exist only if a strong form of Legendre's conjecture that there is a prime between consecutive squares is true. Note that every term is prime. Sequence A189025 gives the number of primes in the range (x-2*sqrt(x), x]. The index of prime a(n), that is, primepi(a(n)), is approximately (5n)^2. These primes are generated in a manner similar to the Ramanujan primes (A104272)."
