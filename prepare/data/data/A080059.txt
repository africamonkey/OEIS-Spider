        "The n-th greedy power of x, when 0.5 < x < 1, is the smallest integer exponent a(n) that does not cause the power series sum_{k=1..n} x^a(k) to exceed unity. A heuristic argument suggests that the limit of a(n)/n is m - sum_{n=m..inf} log(1 + x^n)/log(x) = 14.874449248373..., where x=(1/zeta(3)) and m=floor(log(1-x)/log(x))=9."
