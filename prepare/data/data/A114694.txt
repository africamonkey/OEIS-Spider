        "There are numbers n such that A055081(n) = A055081(n+1) = A055081(n+2), e.g., A055081(91323)=A055081(91324)=A055081(91325)=47; but apparently there are no n's such that A055081(n) = A055081(n+1) = A055081(n+2) = A055081(n+3). Cf. A055081 Number of positive integers whose harmonic mean with n is a positive integer, A114585 Minimal numbers m such that number of positive integers whose harmonic mean with m is n."
