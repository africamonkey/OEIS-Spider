        "For such numbers n, all but 2 of the numbers from 1 to sigma(n) can be represented as the sum of distinct divisors of n. Because the sum of distinct divisors of practical numbers, A005153, can represent all numbers from 1 to sigma(n), it seems fitting to call the numbers in this sequence \"almost practical\". Stewart characterized the odd numbers in this sequence, for which the two excluded numbers are always 2 and sigma(n)-2. However, another possibility is for 4 and sigma(n)-4 to be excluded, which occurs for even numbers in this sequence. See A174534 and A174535."
