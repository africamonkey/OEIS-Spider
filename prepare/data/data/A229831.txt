        "For each n = 1..32, an explicit elliptic curve with a point of order p(n) has been found over a number field of degree n where p(n) = 7, 13, 13, 17, 19, 37, 23, 23, 31, 37, 31, 43, 37, 43, 43, 37, 43, 43, 43, 61, 47, 67, 47, 73, 53, 79, 61, 53, 53, 73, 61, 97.  So p(n) is a lower bound for a(n). I suspect most of them are sharp but that would be difficult to prove. - _Mark van Hoeij_, May 21 2014"
