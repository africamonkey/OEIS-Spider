        "Let m,q,n be positive integers. A cyclic multi de Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence over a q-ary alphabet in which every q-ary word of length n occurs exactly m times. Each such sequence has length m*q^n. Tesler (2017) shows the number of cyclic multi de Bruijn sequences is 1/(m*q^n) Sum_{r|m} phi(m/r) * ((r*q)! / (r!^q))^(q^(n-1)), where phi() is the Euler totient function A000010. Case m=1 is de Bruijn sequences; see A016031 for binary de Bruijn sequences (m=1, q=2, n>=1). Case m=2, q=2, n>=1 is a(n)."

Note that in a cyclic sequence, occurrences may wrap around: in (00010111), there is one 10 in the middle, and another 10 that wraps around from the end to the start. Or, use a different rotation of the sequence: (00010111)=(10001011) shows both occurrences of 10 without wrapping.",
