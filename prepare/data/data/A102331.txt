        "Generalization of A022007. These primes are congruent to 7 modulo 10, so the realization of longer prime-difference pattern={4,8,4,8,4} is not already possible because the sum=4+8+4+8+4=28. Consequently, 10k+7+28=10m+5 cannot be a prime. Thus analogous generalization of A022008 is possible only with restrictions. See also Comment in A102335."
