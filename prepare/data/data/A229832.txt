        "Erd\u0151s called a weak prime A051635 an \"early prime,\" defined to be one which is less than the arithmetic mean of the prime before it and the prime after it. He conjectured that there are infinitely many consecutive pairs of early primes, and offered $100 for a proof and $25000 for a disproof. See Kuperberg 1992.",
