        "Genevieve Paquin, p. 5: \"Lemma 3.7: a Christoffel word can always be written as the product of two palindromes.\" Products of two palindromes in base 10 may be either a palindrome (i.e. 202 * 202 = 40804} or a non-palindrome (i.e. 2 * 88 = 176, or 22 * 33 = 726}. Contains A115683 as a proper subset. The nonpalindromes in this sequence are the same as the non-palindromes in A115683: {10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 32, 35, 36, 40, 42, 45, 48, 49, 54, 56, 63, 64, 72, 81, 110, 132, 154, 165, 176, 198, 220, 231, 264, 275, 297, 302, 308, 322, 330...} which is not yet a sequence in OEIS."
