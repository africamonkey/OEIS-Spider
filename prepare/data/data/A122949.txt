        "From Dixon: The sequence is asymptotic to (n!)^2; when divided by n!^2, it has a high-order asymptotic contact with the probability that two randomly chosen permutations generate the symmetric group. Also: a(n)=(n-1)!*A003319(n+1), where A003319 is the number of connected [or indecomposable] permutations. The coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of a(n)/(n!)^2 are A113869 and in absolute value, they constitute A084357 (number of sets of sets of lists)."
