    "comment": [
        "Such primes are the exceptional p for which x^2 = -2 mod p has a solution, as x^2 = -2 mod p is soluble for *every* p with ord_p(-2) odd. But if ord_p(-2) is even and p-1=2^r.j with j odd, then x^2 = -2 mod p is soluble if and only if ord_p(-2) is not divisible by 2^r.",
        "More generally, the equation x^(2^k) =-2 mod p has a solution iff either ord_p(-2) is odd or ( p = 1 mod 2^(k+1) and ord_p(-2) is even but not divisible by 2^(r-k+1)).",
        "Proof: Choose primitive root g mod p with -2 = g^a mod p, where a=(p-1)/ord_p(-2). Writing x = g^u, see that solving x^(2^k) = -2 mod p is equivalent to solving 2^k.u + (p-1).v = a for some integers u,v.",
        "A necessary and sufficient condition for this is that gcd(2^k,p-1) | a. So for p-1 = 2^r.j, j odd and ord_p(-2) = 2^s.h, h odd, condition becomes min(k,r) <= r-s. If s = 0 (ie ord_p(-2) odd) this is always valid; for positive s we need k < r-s+1, or s < r-k+1."
