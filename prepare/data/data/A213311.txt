        "The sequence is finite. Proof: Each 6-digit number has at least 4 nonprime substrings, and each 4-digit number has at least 1 nonprime substring. Thus, each 10-digit number has at least 5 nonprime substrings. Consequently, there is a boundary b, such that all numbers >= b have more than 4 nonprime substrings.",
