        "Sequence is finite, since for large n and suitable constants and epsilon: phi(n)-2*Tau[n]>c1*n^(2/3)-4c2*n^(1/2)>0 if n>c3, so phi(n)-2*Tau[n]>0, QED. Moreover, phi(n)=k*Tau[n] has at most finitely many solutions for any constant k or even for slowly increasing functions like k(n)=n^(epsilon). - _Labos Elemer_, Jul 20 2001"
