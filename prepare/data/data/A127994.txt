        "Independently determined, these numbers agree with the ranges in the Number of strikes/Number of spares grid of the Balmoral Software page. Note that a(0)=190 > A127993(10)=180; i.e., it's possible to get a higher score with no strikes (and ten optimal (9 pins, then 1 pin) spares followed by 9 pins on the last delivery) than with ten strikes misfortunately timed."
