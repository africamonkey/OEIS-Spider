    "comment": [
        "Original title was \"Primes p such that Ceiling[p/3] + p is prime.\" If p = 1 mod 6, then p/3 falls between 2 and 3 mod 6, and the ceiling function bumps it up to 3 mod 6. Therefore ceiling(p/3) + p = 4 mod 6, which is an even number greater than 2 and therefore obviously composite.",
        "Therefore the ceiling function is only necessary when the primality testing function requires an integer argument.",
        "And so, aside from 2, all terms are congruent to 5 mod 6.",
        "Set q = (p + 1)/3 + p, then (p + 1)/(q + 1) = 3/4. If this sequence is proven infinite, that would prove two specific cases of the Schinzel-Sierpi\u0144ski conjecture regarding rational numbers. - _Alonso del Arte_, Mar 12 2016"
