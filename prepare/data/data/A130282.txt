        "For any n>1, the number (n^2-1)(k^2-1)+1 is a square for k = n-1 ; this sequence lists those n>1 for which there is a smaller k>1 having this property. This sequence contains the subsequence b(k) = 2k(k+1)-1, k>1, for which A130280(b(k)^2-1) <= k < b(k)-1, since (b(k)^2-1)(k^2-1)+1 = (2k^3+2k^2-2k-1)^2. We have n=b(k) whenever 2n+3 is a square, the square root of which is then 2k+1. (See also formula.)",

We have P[2] = P[2](1-X) and for all integers m>2,x>0: P[m](x) < (-1)^m P[m](-x) <= |P[m+1](x)| with equality iff x=2. We have P[m](-1)=(-1)^m (m+1), P[m](0)=(-1)^(m(m+1)/2), P[m](1)=1-m, P[m](x)>0 for all x >=2 ; P[m](x) ~ 2^(m-1) x^m."
