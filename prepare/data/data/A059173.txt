        "Define the gross polygonal sum, GPS(n), of an n-gon as the maximal number of combined points (p), intersections (i), connections (c = edges (e) + diagonals (d)) and areas (a) of a fully connected n-gon, plus the area outside the n-gon. The gross polygonal sum (p + i + c + a + 1) is equal to this sequence and, for all n > 0, then individual components of this sum can be calculated from the first 5 entries in row (n-1) of Pascal's triangle.",
