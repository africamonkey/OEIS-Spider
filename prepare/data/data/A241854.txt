    "comment": [
        "If an integer m is equal to p+1 with p prime, then sigma(p)=m, and it is the maximum such number. The first numbers in the sequence 12, 42, 60, 168, 360, 744, 1512, 2418, 2880 as well as 2437344 are in this case. Curiously, at least up the last known term, this is not the case for the majority of terms of the sequence."

        "Only sigma(1)=1, hence the quotient is 1.",
