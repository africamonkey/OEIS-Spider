        "Conjecture: let a and b be integers such that 0 < a < b so that 0 < a/b is a proper fraction.  Define the map f(a,b,D) = a/b + gcd(a,b)/D. Of course, all such a/b can be partially ordered by value, i.e., 1/2 = 0.5 < 2/3 = 4/6 = 6/9 = 0.6666... < 3/4 = 6/8 = 0.75 < 4/5 = 0.8 etc. The map f appears to specify a total strict order on the co-domain for all a/b that is consistent with the given partial order of the domain, i.e., the partial order remains intact, while equivalent fractions are given a total strict order themselves. Moreover, equivalent fractions are strictly ordered by numerator (or denominator), e.g., 1/2 < 2/4 < 3/6 etc. The conditions are that for n >= 4 all of the fractions with denominator b <= n are listed and the minimum integer value of D to achieve the total strict order of the co-domain is 2*C(n-1,2) - (-1)^(n-1). So, a(n-3) = D for n >= 4. Example: given n = 4, we have D = 2*(4-1,2) - (-1)^(4-1) = 2*3 + 1 = 7 = a(4-3) = a(1). Partial order of domain. 1/4 < 1/3 < 1/2 = 2/4 < 2/3 < 3/4. Total order of co-domain. f(1,4,7) = 1/4 + 1/7 = 33/84 < f(1,3,7) = 1/3 + 1/7 = 40/84 < f(1,2,7) = 1/2 + 1/7 = 54/84 < f(2,4,7) = 2/4 + 2/7 = 66/84 < f(2,3,7) = 2/3 + 2/7 = 68/84 < f(3,4,7) = 3/4 + 1/7 = 75/84. Observe that if D = 6, then f(2,4,6) = 2/4 + 2/6 = 10/12 = f(2,3,6) = 2/3 + 1/6. Computation shows the same failure to achieve total strict order of the co-domain for D = 2..5. (As a >= 1, then b >=2, from the above). Computation also shows that the conjecture holds for n = 4..17. - _Ross La Haye_, Oct 02 2016"
