        "Let X_n be the set of all noncrossing set partitions of an n-element set that do not contain {n-1, n} as a block, and also do not contain the block {n} whenever 1 and n-1 are in the same block. a(n) is the number of elements of X_{n+2} in which n-2 and n-1 lie in the same block.",
        "Equivalently, a(n) is the number of noncrossing set partitions of {1, 2, ..., n+2} such that n and n+1 belong to the same block, and if 1 also belongs to this block then n+2 does as well. This leads to the formula a(n) = C(n + 1) - C(n - 1), where C(n) is the n-th Catalan number (A000108): there are C(n + 1) noncrossing set partitions with n and n + 1 in the same block, and C(n - 1) noncrossing set partitions with {n + 2} a singleton block and 1, n, and n + 1 in the same block. - _Joel B.
