    "comment": [
        "The number of steps for the recurrence in this sequence stopping at 1 compares closely to the steps in the pi(n) recurrence stopping at 0. If we define Li(1) = 0 and allow that step then A(using Li seq#) - A(using pi seq#) = 1 for n <=13. So one may conjecture the steps in the Li method is always 1 greater than the steps in the pi method. Question is can the difference be greater than 1? For the largest value allowed in the link (3*10^13) A(Li) = 17 (assuming L1(1)= 0) and n=13 A(pi) = 16 from Booker so the difference = 1 as before."
