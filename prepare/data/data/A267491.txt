    "comment": [
        "The T operator numerically summarizes the frequency of digits 0 through 2 in that order when they occur in a number. The numbers and the frequency are written in base 3.",
        "These are all autobiographical numbers in base 3 which lead to a fixed-point or belong to a cycle. However, in base 3 there is only one cycle with length 3, all other terms are fixed-points.",
        "10011112, 10101102, 2012112 is a cycle of length 3, which means T(10011112)=10101102, T(10101102)=2012112, T(2012112)=10011112."
