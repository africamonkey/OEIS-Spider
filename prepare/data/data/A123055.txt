        "Comment from Max Alekseyev, Sep 26 2006: The n-th prime appear in the sequence of first differences (A075568) not later than at the 2n-th position. To see this it is enough to notice that in the original sequence (excluding the first element) odd and even numbers alternate. Therefore from each odd element m the sequence simply jumps to an even element m+p where p is the smallest previously unused prime."
