    "comment": [
        "Trivial cases are those numbers which upon conversion result in a number which is palindromic (m = reverse(m)), or a palindrome plus trailing zeros such that m = reverse(m)*10^z where z=number of lost zeros. Nontrivial digit loss occurs when a converted number has trailing zeros that drop off when the number is reversed."
