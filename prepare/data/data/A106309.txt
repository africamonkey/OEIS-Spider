        "Consider the 5-step recursion x(k)=x(k-1)+x(k-2)+x(k-3)+x(k-4)+x(k-5) mod n. For any of the n^5 initial conditions x(1), x(2), x(3), x(4) and x(5) in Zn, the recursion has a finite period. When n is a prime in this sequence, all of the orbits, except the one containing (0,0,0,0,0), have the same length."
