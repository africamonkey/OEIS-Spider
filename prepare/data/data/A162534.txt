    "comment": [
        "By \"run\" of 0's or 1's, it is meant: Think of binary n as a string of 0's and 1's. A single run of the digit b (0 or 1) is made up completely of consecutive digits all equal to b, and is bounded on its end by either the digit 1-b or by the edge of the string."

        "198 in binary is 11000110. There are two runs of two 1's each in this representation, and a run of three 0's and a run of one 0. Since 198 is divisible by each of these lengths (1,2, and 3), then 198 is in the sequence."
