        "May be computed found using convergents to the continued fraction for Pi. If cos(a(n)) is near -1, then a(n) is near an odd multiple of Pi. That is, a(n)/(2k+1) is a good rational approximation to Pi with an odd denominator (and continued fractions give good rational approximations).",
        "If a convergent of the continued fraction for Pi has an odd denominator then the corresponding numerator is a term in this sequence. Otherwise add one to the last term in the convergent to get an approximation of Pi with an odd denominator. In this case, we may get a duplicate of the next convergent which we may just ignore.",
