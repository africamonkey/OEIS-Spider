        "This sequence is closed under multiplication. A067945 is a subsequence of this sequence.A067945 is also closed under multiplication. In fact if m is an integer and k is a natural number then the sequence \" n divides m^n^k - 1 \" is a subsequence of the sequence \" n divides m^n^(k+1)- 1 \" and both are closed under multiplication.",
