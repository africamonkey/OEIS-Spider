    "example": [
        "Pick the leftmost \"5\" and jump 5 digits (to the right): you'll land on another \"5\".",
        "Pick the third \"6\" (visible in 63) and jump 6 digits (to the right): you'll land on another \"6\" (161). [Jumping again 6 digits from there to the right would send you on another \"6\" (286), which is allowed].",
        "Pick the first \"0\" (300) and jump 0 digits (to the right): you'll move to the next digit, which is a \"0\".",
        "Note that the rule (2) forbids integers like \"323\" because if you pick one of those 3's the *closest* copy is at a \"1\" jump -- and not at a \"3\" jump, which is mandatory."
