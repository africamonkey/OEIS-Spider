        "42 = 6 x 7 = hexagon (six sides) x 7 tiles = one hexagon with 6 other copies surrounding it",
        "Each number in the sequence has a prime factorization which uniquely determines whether it corresponds to a triangular, square or hexagonal tiling and the tiling's size. Factorization and rewriting into canonical form effectively becomes the inverse operation of \"mixing\" the three initial sequences."
