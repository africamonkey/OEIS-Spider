In general p-wild partitions of n are defined so that they are in bijection with geometric equivalence classes of degree n algebra extensions of the p-adic field Q_p. Here two algebra extensions are equivalent if they become isomorphic after tensoring with the maximal unramified extension of Q_p.",

        "In general, the number of p-wild partitions of n is equal to the number of partitions of n if and only if n<p. From n=p onward, there are many more p-wild partitions."
