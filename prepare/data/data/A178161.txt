        "The values given as a(4), a(8), and a(11) each include exactly one type-2 Trott-like constant that cannot be extended to additional digits (see A178164). All the rest, including every constant counted in each of the other terms, can be extended by an arbitrary number of additional digits."

        "There are 63 type-2 Trott-like constants that have exactly 2 digits after the decimal point (0.11 ... 0.16, 0.21 ... 0.27, 0.31 ... 0.37, 0.42 ... 0.48, 0.52 ... 0.58, 0.62 ... 0.68, 0.72 ... 0.78, 0.82 ... 0.88, and 0.92 ... 0.99), so a(2) = 63."
