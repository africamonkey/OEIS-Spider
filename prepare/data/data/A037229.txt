        "It is known (see references) that, for n>15, phi(n)>n/(e^c*log(log(n))+3) and pi(n)<1.25506*n/log(n), where c is the Euler constant. Therefore, there are no terms, at least, for n satisfying the inequality: log(n)/(e^c*log(log(n))+3)>1.25506... So, for, e.g., n>=5500, there are no terms. Besides, by the direct verification, we find that interval (90,5500) contains no terms as well. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Aug 27 2011"
