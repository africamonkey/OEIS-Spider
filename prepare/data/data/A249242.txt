Primitive abundant can also be defined as \"having only deficient proper divisors\", cf. A071395. The corresponding squarefree terms are listed in A298973, and those with n prime factors are counted in A295369. (The preceding remark shows that this count would be infinite for n = 3, using the definition of A091191.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 16 2018"
