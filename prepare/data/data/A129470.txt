        "In practice the class+ of a prime p is most often given by 1 + the class of the largest prime factor of p+1; elements of this sequence are counter-examples to this \"rule\". Elements of this sequence are at least of class 3+, since primes of class 1+ and 2+ have all prime factors of p+1 of class 1+. Elements a(k) of this sequence are >= -1+2*A005113[N-1]*nextprime(A005113[N-1]), where N is the class of a(k)."
