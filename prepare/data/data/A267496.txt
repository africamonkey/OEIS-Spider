        "The T operator numerically summarizes the frequency of digits 0 through 7 in that order when they occur in a number. The numbers and the frequency are written in base 8.",
        "These are all autobiographical numbers in base 8 which lead to a fixed-point or belong to a cycle.",
        "44 numbers are fixed-points. There are 7 cycles with length 2 and three cycles with length 3."
