        "Generating polynomial is Schur's polynomial of 4-degree. Schur's polynomials n degree are n-th first term of series expansion of e^x function. All polynomials are non-reducible and belonging to the An alternating Galois transitive group if n is divisible by 4 or to Sn symmetric Galois Group in other case (proof Schur, 1930)."
