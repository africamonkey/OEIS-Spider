        "20 in binary is 10100. The distinct primes dividing 20 are 2 and 5, which are 10 and 101 in binary. Both 10 and 101 occur in 10100, but with overlapping. So 20 is not in this sequence. However, 54 in binary is 110110. 54 is divisible by 2 and 3, which are 10 and 11 in binary. Both 10 and 11 occur in 110110 without overlapping. (1{10}{11}0.) So 54 is in this sequence."
