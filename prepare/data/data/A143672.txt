        "For each n, each vertex in the Hasse diagram of the poset corresponds to a Dyck path of size n. The chain polynomial, C(P,t)=(1 + sum_k(c_k*t^(k+1)), gives the breakdown of this sequence by number of vertices in the chain. The 1 in front of the sum in this equation denotes the empty chain. The coefficient, c_k, gives the number of chains of length k and the exponent, (k+1), indicates the number of vertices in the chain. Here are the chain polynomials corresponding to this sequence:",
