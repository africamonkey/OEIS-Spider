    "comment": [
        "In 1968, Sister Beiter conjectured that for n = p*q*r, with odd primes p < q < r, the maximum coefficient (in absolute value) of the cyclotomic polynomial Phi(n,x) is <= (p+1)/2. Up to 10^6, all counterexamples have p>7. Gallot and Moree prove the conjecture is false for p>7."
