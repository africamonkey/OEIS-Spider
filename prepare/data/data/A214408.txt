        "The abundance of a number is sigma(n) - 2n (A033880).",
        "Most of these numbers are pseudoperfect (A005835), but more than one proper divisor is left out of the sum.",
        "The first odd term is 945, the second is 1575. The smallest odd abundant number not in this sequence is 173369889, found by _Donovan Johnson_. _Peter J. C. Moses_ has verified all other odd abundant numbers up to 1.4 * 10^19 have an abundance that is not a proper divisor.",
        "Almost all multiples of 6 are in this sequence. Given a prime p > 3, the abundance of 6p works out to 12, but 6p is not divisible by 4, though it is by 2 and by 3. The abundance of 12p is 16p + 28, and clearly that is not a divisor of 12p. Multiples of 6 with more prime factors will have abundances that are greater than the largest proper divisor by greater margins still."
