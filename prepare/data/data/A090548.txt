        "In the following triangle the n-th row contains the least set of n numbers in arithmetic progression with the same number of divisors. By \"least\" we mean that the largest term is minimized. Sequence contains the leading diagonal. In other words, largest of n numbers in arithmetic progression with the same tau function, or 0 if no such number exists."
