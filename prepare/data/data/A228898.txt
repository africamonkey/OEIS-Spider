        "The tree has infinitely many branches which are essentially linear recurrence sequences (and infinitely many which are not).  The extreme branches are (1,2)->(2,3)->(3,5)->(5,8)->... and (1,2)->(2,5)->(5,29)->(29,866)->...  These branches contribute to A228898, as subsequences, the Fibonacci numbers, A000045, and A000283."
