        "A Y-toothpick (or Y-shaped toothpick) is formed from three toothpicks of length 1, like a star with three endpoints and only one middle-point.",
        "On the infinite triangular grid, we start at round 0 with no Y-toothpicks.",
        "At round 1 we place a Y-toothpick anywhere in the plane.",
        "At round 2 we add three more Y-toothpicks. After round 2, in the structure there are three rhombuses and a hexagon.",
        "At round 3 we add three more Y-toothpicks.",
        "And so on ... (see illustrations).",
        "The sequence gives the number of Y-toothpicks after n rounds. A160121 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.",
        "The Y-toothpick pattern has a recursive, fractal (or fractal-like) structure.",
        "Note that, on the infinite triangular grid, a Y-toothpick can be represented as a polyedge with three components. In this case, at the n-th round, the structure is a polyedge with 3*a(n) components.",
        "This structure is more complex than the toothpick structure of A139250. For example, at some rounds we can see inward growth.",
        "The structure contains distinct polygons which have side length equal to 1.",

        "Observation: It appears that the number of distinct polygons that contain non-covered grid points is infinite.",
        "This sequence appears to be related to powers of 2. For example:",
        "Conjecture: It appears that if n = 2^k, k>0, then, between the other polygons, there appears a new centered hexagon formed by three rhombuses with side length = 2^k/2 = n/2.",
        "Conjecture: Consider the perimeter of the structure. It appears that if n = 2^k, k>0, then the structure is a triangle-shaped polygon with A000225(k)*6 sides and a half toothpick in each vertice of the \"triangle\".",

        "For an alternative visualization replace every single toothpick with a rhombus, or in other words, replace every Y-toothpick with the \"three-diamond\" symbol, so we have a cellular automaton in which a(n) gives the total number of \"three-diamond\" symbols after n-th stage and A160167(n) counts the total number of \"ON\" diamonds in the structure after n-th stage.
