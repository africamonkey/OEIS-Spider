        "Except for a(1) = 7, these are the primes which can be written in the form a^2 + 7*b^2 with a > 0 and b > 0. - _V. Raman_, Sep 08 2012",
        "These are the primes p for which p^3 - 1 is divisible by 7.  There are two exceptions: p = 2 is not in the sequence even though 2^3 - 1 is divisible by 7, and p = 7 is in the sequence even though 7^3 - 1 is not divisible by 7.  Except for p = 7, if p^3 - 1 is not divisible by 7, it is congruent to 5 (mod 7). - _Richard R. Forberg_, Jun 03 2013"
