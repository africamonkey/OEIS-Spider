        "Finite if one excludes multiple strokes chiseled over the letter, each meaning multiplication by 1000. The subsequence \"primes requiring a prime number of chisel strokes for its representation in Roman numerals\" begins 2, 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 43, 53, 59, 61, 71, 83, 89, 101, 103. This sequence uses the definition of strokes given in A002963, not A118098."
