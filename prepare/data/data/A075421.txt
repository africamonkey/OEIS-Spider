        "For 318 (cf. A075153), 266718 (cf. A075466) and 270798 (cf. A075467) one can prove that the base 4 trajectory does not contain a palindrome. A proof for 290 (cf. A075299) has not been found up to now. 4398859679359 is another known candidate (obtained from a remark of _David J. Seal_, cf. Links) for a term whose trajectory is provably palindrome-free, but is not secured that it does not join the trajectory of some term m < n. - If the trajectory of an integer k joins the trajectory of a smaller integer which is a term of the present sequence, then this occurs after very few Reverse and Add! steps (at most 28 for k < 20000). On the other hand, the trajectories of the terms listed above do not join the trajectory of any smaller term within at least 1000 steps.",
