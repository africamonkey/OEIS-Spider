        "These are numbers i which do not occur on the unique infinite path of A179016, although there exist such k for which A000120(i+k)=k.  For example, with the first term 10, we have cases k=2 and 3, as A000120(10+2)=2 and A000120(10+3)=3. Still, it's not possible to proceed further up from either 12 or 13, as they both are members of A055938."
