    "comment": [
        "n must be of the form 4k+1 since if n is even, n-1 or n+1 would be 4k+3, thus n+2 and n-2 are 4k+3 and therefore: 3 is the maximum number of consecutive integers which can be expressed as a sum of 2 squares in at least 2 ways. n or n-1 or n+1 must be of the following forms: n=3^s*(4k+1)*(4k+3)^t or n+1=2*3^s*(4k+1)*(4k+3)^t or n-1=2^u*3^s*(4k+1)*(4k+3)^t (s>=2,t>=0;s and t even,u>=3) (only one of n-1,n,n+1 must be a multiple of an even power of 3)."
