    "comment": [
        "Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions suggests that average gaps between primes of the form 6k + 1 below x are about phi(6)*log(x). This sequence shows that the record gap ending at p grows almost as fast as phi(6)*log^2(p). Here phi(n) is A000010, Euler's totient function; phi(6)=2.",

        "A268927 lists the corresponding primes at the end of the maximal gaps."

    "example": [
        "The first two primes of the form 6k+1 are 7 and 13, so a(1)=13-7=6. The next prime of this form is 19; the gap 19-13 is not a record so nothing is added to the sequence. The next prime of this form is 31; the gap 31-19=12 is a new record, so a(2)=12."
