    "comment": [
        "A Fibonacci number with a composite index is divisible by the Fibonacci numbers indexed by the divisors of the index (e.g., F(12) is divisible by F(3), F(4), F(6)), which would suggest that Fibonacci numbers indexed by primes are also themselves primes. This sequence clearly shows that not to be the case."
