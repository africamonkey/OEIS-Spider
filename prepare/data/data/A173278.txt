        "Partial sums of number of n-bead necklaces with beads of 2 colors and primitive period n, when turning over is not allowed but the two colors can be interchanged. Partial sums of 2n-bead balanced binary necklaces of fundamental period 2n that are equivalent to their complements. Partial sums of binary Lyndon words of length n with an odd number of 1's. Partial sums of number of binary Lyndon words with trace 1 over GF(2). Partial sums of number of binary irreducible polynomials of degree n having trace 1. For more equivalences see A000048. The subsequence of primes in this partial sum begins: 2, 3, 23, 67, 211, 1403789."
