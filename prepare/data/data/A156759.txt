        "Apart from a(1), this is a sequence of increasing composites such that the derived sequence of their least prime factors is nondecreasing. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 20 2009",
        "Except for a(1)=2, this is the sequence of numbers k such that the smallest prime factor of k is the largest prime less than or equal to the square root of k. - _Michael J. Hardy_, Nov 29 2013",
        "If, using the standard primality test for a number N by dividing N by consecutive primes <= sqrt(N), it is only on the last step that we conclude that N is not prime, then we call N a \"preprime\". So, by the last comment, the sequence of preprimes coincides with this sequence for n>=2. Note that, except for 8, all preprimes are semiprimes. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Sep 14 2014"
