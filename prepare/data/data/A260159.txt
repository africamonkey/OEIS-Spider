        "A permutation is minimal overlapping if the shortest permutation containing two consecutive occurrences of it has length 2n-1. It is also called non-overlapping. A263867(n) is the number of minimal overlapping permutations of length n.",
        "a(n) is asymptotically less than A260156(n) which is the number of minimal overlapping permutations starting with 1 of length n."
