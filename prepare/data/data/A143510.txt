        "In the unlikely event that Carmichael's conjecture is proved false, the counterexamples will be in this sequence. The number a(1) = 16842752 = 257*2^16 is mentioned in problem E3361. If there are only five Fermat primes, then 2^k is in this sequence for all k>31. It appears that for every product d of Fermat primes (A143512), the number 2^k * d is in this sequence for some k. The link to \"Numbers Like 16842752\" lists examples for various d."
