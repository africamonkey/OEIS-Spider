    "comment": [
        "A graph is called rigid, if, when we fix the length of each edge, it has only finitely many embeddings in the plane. A graph is called minimally rigid (or Laman graph) if there is no edge that can be omitted while keeping the rigidity property. Laman graphs can be constructed by applying successively Henneberg moves (of type I or type II), starting with the graph that consists of two vertices joined by an edge. Here we consider Laman graphs that can be obtained by using only Henneberg type I moves, which means: adding one vertex and joining it with two different existing vertices."
