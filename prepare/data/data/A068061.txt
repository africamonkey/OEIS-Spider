        "Intersection of A002113 and A067031. Every palindrome with an even number of digits is of the form k + reverse(k), for example 123321 = 123000 + 000321, so the sequence has no terms with an even number of digits.",
        "It seems that the terms follow a strict pattern: x1x', x3x', x5x', x7x', x9x', y1y', y3y', y5y', y7y', y9y' and so on. x' is reverse(x). Apart from the first 5 terms in the sequence, the surrounding terms (x and y) simply iterate over the positive integers. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Mar 10 2017"
