        "The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [RED ; NEUTRAL ; BLUE], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the sequence is optimal (the sequence presented gives the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle for the given pre-coloring configuration). Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",
        "Number of moves to solve the given puzzle, for large N, is close to 0.5*(8/11)*3^N ~ 0.5*0.727*3^(N). Series designation: S727(N)."
