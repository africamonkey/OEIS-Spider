        "The definition implies that the prime factors are not palindromes. The converse is not true. For instance, prime factors of 1681861 are 17, 19, 41, 127, which are not palindromes, but its aliquot parts are 1, 17, 19, 41, 127, 323, 697, 779, 2159, 2413, 5207, 13243, 41021, 88519, 98933, and 323 is a palindrome.",
