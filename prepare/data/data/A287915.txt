        "Sequence A007443, the binomial transform of the primes A000040, is defined as A007443(n) = Sum_(k=1,n) binomial(n-1,k-1)*prime(k). This is also the first column of the infinite square array T(m,n) with T(1,n) = prime(n) and T(m+1,n) = T(m,n) + T(m,n+1), as for binomial coefficients. Successive rows result from applying this operation of taking the sum of successive terms. So it would be more natural to use index 0 for the first term of this sequence (which is also the only even term, and results from applying the operation 0 times to the primes). This would yield the sequence 0,1,2,4,8,21,24,27,31,40,98,103,137,182,... - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 02 2017"
