        "Equal to A256969 except for n = 2 and n = 3. The following argument shows that they are equal for n > 3. First note that b(k+1) > b(k). Next, Product_{i=1..k} p_i is 2 times an odd number, i.e., it is not divisible by 4. Similarly since p_i - 1 is even for i > 1, Product_{i=1..k} (p_i - 1) is divisible by 2^(k-1), i.e., it is divisible by 4 for k >= 3. Thus b(k) is not an integer for k >= 3. Since b(3) = 15/4 > 3, this means that A256969(n) = A256968(n) for n > 3 - _Chai Wah Wu_, Apr 17 2015"
