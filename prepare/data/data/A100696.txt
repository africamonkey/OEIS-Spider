        "This sequence was posed as a puzzle by Prof. E. A. Roganov from Moscow State Industrial University at one of his seminars. It remained unsolved for several years. The solution (cf. current definition) was eventually revealed by the author (communicated by _Max Alekseyev_ on Apr 19 2012).",
        "It may be easily noticed that for an abundant number m, if the sum of its divisors below A033880(m) is smaller than A033880(m), then m is necessarily weird. So A100696 lists those weird numbers that cannot be detected this way. - _Max Alekseyev_, Apr 19 2012"
