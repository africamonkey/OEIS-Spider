    "comment": [
        "We consider cyclic compositions (necklaces) as equivalence classes of compositions that can be obtained from each other by a cyclic shift. A cyclic composition is called Sommerville symmetrical (on a symmetric necklace) if its equivalence class contains at least one palindromic composition (type I) or a composition that becomes a palindromic composition if we remove the first part (type II). A composition with only one part is a palindromic composition of both types.",
        "The equivalence class of each Sommerville symmetrical cyclic composition that is Carlitz contains exactly two type II palindromic Carlitz compositions (except in the case of a composition with only one part). For example, when n=8, the equivalence class {(1,2,3,2), (2,3,2,1), (3,2,1,2), (2,1,2,3)} represents a Sommerville symmetrical cyclic composition of n=8 that is Carlitz, but only two of the compositions in the set, i.e., (1,2,3,2) and (3,2,1,2), are type II palindromic."
