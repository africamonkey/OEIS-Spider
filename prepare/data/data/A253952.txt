        "One step consists of taking the number in base 4 and inserting some plus signs between the digits with no restrictions and adding the resulting numbers together in base 4. The numbers given here cannot be taken to a single digit in one or two steps. It is known that three steps always suffice to get to a single digit, and that there are infinitely many numbers that require three steps."
