        "The digits at position 1667 are \"334\", so according to the strict definition of this sequence, a(33) is 1667 and a(34) is 1668. However, this would not enable a person to mark in bold-face the counting numbers within the digits of pi, which was the inspiration for this sequence. Surprisingly, if overlapping is not allowed, this changes only one element of the sequence. a(34) becomes 1700 and a(35) remains 1719. No other overlapping occurs within the first 100,000 decimal digits of Pi. - _Graeme McRae_, Mar 20 2005"
