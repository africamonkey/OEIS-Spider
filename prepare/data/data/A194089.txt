        "A biconnected squaregraph is \"labeled\" if one of the edges on its periphery is given an orientation. The a(2)=3 examples with n=2 are the domino together with two possible ways to orient one of the edges on its \"long\" side, and one way to orient an edge on the short side. If a squaregraph has m automorphisms and perimeter 2p, the number of different ways to label it is 4p/m."
