    "comment": [
        "Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions suggests that average gaps between primes of the form 10k + 1 below x are about phi(10)*log(x). This sequence shows that the record gap ending at p grows almost as fast as phi(10)*log^2(p). Here phi(n) is A000010, Euler's totient function; phi(10)=4.",

        "The first two primes of the form 10k + 1 are 11 and 31, so a(1)=31-11=20. The next primes of this form are 41, 61, 71; the gaps 41-31, 61-41, 71-61 are not records so nothing is added to the sequence. The next prime of this form is 101 and the gap 101-71=30 is a new record, so a(2)=30."
