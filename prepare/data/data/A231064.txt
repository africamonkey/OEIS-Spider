        "The X pattern (8c5s2 type) is a pattern in which 8 curves cover 5 coins, and is one of a total of 13 such distinct patterns that appear in a tightly-packed 3 X 3 square array of coins of identical size; each of the 8 curves is a circular arc lying along the edge of one of the 5 coins, and the 8 curves are joined end-to-end to form a continuous area.",
        "a(n) is the total number of coins left (the coins out side X patterns) after packing X patterns into an n X n array of coins. The maximum number of X patterns that can be packed into an n X n array of coins is A231056 and voids left is A231065.",
