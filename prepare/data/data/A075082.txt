        "Subsequence of A034878 (all n such that n! is a product of smaller factorials). It is conjectured that A034878 and A001013 (Jordan-Polya numbers = products of factorials) are the same sequence (except for the numbers 2, 9 and 10). If this is true, then obviously A075082 (without the number 10) is also a subsequence of A001013. On the other hand, this special case of the conjecture might be easier to prove. (a(n)!)^2 is a member of A058295 (products of distinct factorials); for example, (6!)^2 = 6!*5!*3!. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 21 2004",
