        "The sequence is infinite, since repeating 105263157894736842 any number of times (e.g. 105263157894736842105263157894736842) gives another number with the same property.",
        "A number N = 10n+m is in the sequence iff 2N = m*10^d+n, where d is the number of digits of n = [N/10]. This is equivalent to 19n = m(10^d-2), i.e. 10^d=2 (mod 19) and n = m(10^d-2)/19, m=2..9 (to ensure that n has d digits). Thus for each d = 18j-1, j=1,2,3... we have exactly 8 solutions which are the j-fold repetition of one among {a(1),...,a(8)}. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 04 2009",
