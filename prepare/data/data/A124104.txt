        "From _Joshua Zucker_, Dec 21 2006: (Start)",
        "Given a partition of {1, ..., n}, look at a pair of elements. If the two elements are in the same block of the partition, they're called \"co-clustered\". The Rand distance between two partitions then counts the pairs that are co-clustered in exactly one of the two partitions. The Rand index is found by dividing the Rand distance by (n choose 2).",
        "Example: The distance from 12 3 4 to 1 234 is 4 because of the four pairs 12 (in the first partition but not the second) and 23, 24, 34 (in the second partition but not the first). The maximal distance of 6 is attained by 1 2 3 4 and 1234. The Rand distance has some nice properties, satisfies the triangle inequality and there are linear-time algorithms for computing it. (End)"
