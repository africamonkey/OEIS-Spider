        "x is an element of this sequence if when m>1 is the least natural number such that the least positive residue of x mod m! is no more than (m-2)!, floor[x/(m!)] is not congruent to m-1 mod m. The sequence is made up of the residue classes 1 mod 4; 2 and 8 mod 18; 4, 6, 28, 30, 52 and 54 mod 96, etc. A set of such sequences with entries for each zeta(k) - 1 partitions the integers. See the linked paper for their construction.",
