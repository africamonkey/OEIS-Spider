        "Determining whether n is a term of this sequence can be approached by considering odd and even factors separately, and exploiting the fact that numerator(zeta(2n)/(Pi^(2n))) = numerator(2^(2n-2)*N_2n/(D_2n*(2n)!)), where N_2n and D_2n are odd coprime integers such that Bernoulli(2n) = N_2n/2D_2n.",
        "Case 1: odd factors. n is a term if it has an odd prime factor p (necessarily irregular) that divides N_2n at a higher multiplicity than it divides (2n)!. No such factor p of N_2n up to 2n = 10000 is of sufficient multiplicity, and the apparent scarcity of squared and higher power factors of N_2n values (see A090997) suggests that no such p is likely to exist.",
        "Case 2: even factors. An even n is a term if 2 divides 2^(2n-2) at a higher multiplicity than it divides (2n)!. The multiplicity of 2 in 2^(2n-2) is 2n-2, and in (2n)! is 2n minus the number of 1's in the binary expansion of 2n (see A005187). Qualifying n values are therefore those where the number of 1's in the binary expansion of 2n is greater than 2. Except for its first term, A072823 comprises integers with three or more 1-bits in their binary expansion. It follows that for m > 1, 2*A072823(m) values belong to this sequence.",
        "In summary, this sequence is essentially a supersequence of 2*A072823. Conjectures 1 and 2 are true if there are no irregular odd primes p that divide n and the numerator of Bernoulli(2n)/(2n)!. (End)"
