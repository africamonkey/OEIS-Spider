        "If you consider that you are \"sieving\" from the even number down and from 1 up, then if the even number is a power of 2 this is exactly a two-stage sieve, but you must include the 3, so each term is multiplied by 3. For other even numbers, all two-stage sieves including 3 will over-exclude numbers, so if anything is left after the sieve, it must be prime, excluding the number 1.",
        "Consider the following: Let p be the largest prime < sqrt(2N), further let p be the m-th prime. Let's deal with the m-th term in the sequence a(m). If a(m)*3 < (N - 2) for all N > K for some constant K, there is a set of two primes that sum to 2N. (End)",

The condition a(k) >= m can be verified by solving an integer linear programming problem with binary variables x_i_j, where i ranges between 3 and k and j ranges between 0 and prime(k)-1, and x_i_j = 1 if a_i = j or b_i = j.",
