    "comment": [
        "A 3-pillow is also called an Aztec pillow. The 3-pillow of order n is a rotationally-symmetric region. It has a 2 X 2n central band of squares and then steps up from this band with steps of 3 horizontal squares to every 1 vertical square and steps down with steps of 1 horizontal square to every 1 vertical square."
