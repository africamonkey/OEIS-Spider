        "The complement of A258882 in A002975, i.e., primitive weird numbers not of the form 2^k*p*q with primes p, q. Equivalently, subsequence of A002975 for numbers with at least 3 odd prime factors, counting multiplicity. (No weird number is of the form 2^k*p^m.) Note that, e.g., a(40) = 2^6 * 137^2 * 1931 and a(143) = 2^8 * 797^2 * 1429 have only 3 distinct prime factors.",
