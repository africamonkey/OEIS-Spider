        "There is no maximum number of steps and for any value of n, there MUST be a term a(n) that reduces in n steps. This is demonstrable as follows: take any term in the above sequence and convert it to base 2. The resulting value, if interpreted as a base 10 value will require one additional step to reduce. The resulting value may not be the FIRST value to resolve in that many steps, however, so it may not belong in this sequence."
