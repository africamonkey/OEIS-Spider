        "Considering parity, a prime sum of three cubes cannot be the sum of three evens nor two odds and an even, but must be the sum of three odds (such as 1^3 + 3^3 + 9^3 = 757 or 3^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 881) or two evens and an odd (such as 1^3 + 2^3 + 10^3 = 1009). Without \"distinct\" we have solutions such as 1^3 + 1^3 + 3^3 = 29; 2^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 43; 1^3 + 1^3 + 5^3 = 127. A subset of the three odds subset is primes which are the sum of the cubes of three distinct primes, such as 3^3 + 5^3 + 11^3 = 1483; or 3^3 + 7^3 + 19^3 = 7229; or 7^3 + 11^3 + 23^3 = 13841; or 3^3 + 5^3 + 41^3 = 69073."
