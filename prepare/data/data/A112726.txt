    "comment": [
        "a(0)=1; a(1)=3 and it is easily shown that for n>1, 10^3^(n-2)-1 is a multiple of 3^n whose reverse is also a multiple of 3^n (see comments line of A062567), so for each n, a(n) exists and for n>1, a(n)<=10^3^(n-2)-1. This sequence is a subsequence of A062567, a(n)=A062567(3^n). Jud McCranie conjectures that for n>1, a(n)=10^3^(n-2)-1 (see comments line of A062567), but we see that for n>4, a(n) is much smaller than 10^3^(n-2)-1, so his conjecture is rejected. It seems that only for n=2,3 & 4 we have, a(n)=10^3^(n-2)-1."
