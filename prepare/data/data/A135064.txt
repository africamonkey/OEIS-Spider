        "Sequence appears to agree with the Lucas bisection A002878 for n > 1. - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Nov 18 2007",
        "A002878(n) is in this sequence for all 1 < n <= 1000, and the sequences agree through a(20) = 370248451. Of course this is not a proof. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 03 2017, updated Mar 20 2017",
        "If this agreement is provable then of course it provides recurrences, generating functions, etc., for this sequence. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 24 2007 However, at present this is only a conjecture, and should not be used as the basis for formulas or computer programs. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 04 2017",
        "Comparing A135064 with A002878, the number 4 is missing. In this case the Galois group of the quintic polynomial x^5 - 40*x^2 - 96 is dihedral of order 10. - _Artur Jasinski_, May 27 2010",
        "The relation with A002878 is proved in Wong's article. - _Eric M. Schmidt_, Nov 25 2017"
