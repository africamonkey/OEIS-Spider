Overlapping are prohibited. The sequence gives the number of pentagons in the structure after n-th stage. A222181 (the first differences) gives the number of pentagons added at n-th stage.",
        "Also this is a P-toothpick sequence since every pentagon can be replaced by a P-toothpick which is formed by five toothpicks as a five-pointed star. Note that each toothpick can be represented as an apothem or as a radius of a pentagon. In both types of structures the number of toothpicks after n-th stage is equal to 5*a(n)."
