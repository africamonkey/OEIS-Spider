        "First differs from A243252 (connected simple graphs whose fractional number equals its chromatic number) at a(8). The three (connected) 8-node graphs that have equal chromatic and fractional chromatic numbers but are not weakly perfect are the 4-antiprism graph and 50- and 84-Johnson solid skeleton graphs, all of which have clique number 3 but chromatic and fractional chromatic number 4."
