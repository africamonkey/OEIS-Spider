        "The radius of the inter-hypersphere of a regular simplex of dimension k with unit edge is given by r=Sqrt((k-j)/(2*(k+1)*(j+1))) where 0<=j<k and j is the dimension of the hypersurface that the inter-hypersphere is tangent to. j=0 gives the radius of the circum-hypersphere and j=k-1 gives the radius of the in-hypersphere. The sequence identifies those dimensions k for which at least one inter-hypersphere has a rational radius."
