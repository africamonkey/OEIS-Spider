        "For prime p in this sequence, b(p) = r*b(p-r) where b(m) = A288814(m), and r = gpf(b(p)) is some prime < q. We can say that prime p_n (n>2)is of type k (>=1) if gpf(b(p_n)) = p_n - k. In the first ~4210 primes, most (~94%) are of type k=1, meaning that b(p) = q*b(p-q). Data presented here lists the first 257 primes of type k > 1. These include 219 of type 2, 27 of type 3, 9 of type 4, and 2 (25523, 39293) of type 5. One type k=6 prime (81611) has also been found but is not included above because it is not consecutive to the above terms. It is not known if there are primes of type k > 6 (although it is tempting to conjecture that k may be  unbounded). Prime gap p-q, and pattern of gaps p-r determines if p is in the sequence or not. Prime p is of type k > 2 only if p-q is one of the even indices of A056240 on which A292081 is defined (12,18,24,28,30,36,...), and if there is a prime r < q < p such that b(p-r) < b(p-q). Based on above data the primes in this sequence are all \"Overdue\" (A060769)."

        "p=211 is a candidate for inclusion because p-q = 211-199 = 12, and b(12)=35 is a term in A292081. Since r=197 is the next prime below q, p-r = 14 and b(14) = 33 < 35, 211 is in the sequence, of type 2. Conversely, p=809, which also has gap p-q = 12, is not in the sequence because the only number n > 12 for which b(n) < b(12)=35 is n=14, and p-14 = 795 is not prime. Therefore b(809) = 797*b(12) = 27895, and 809 is of type 1."
