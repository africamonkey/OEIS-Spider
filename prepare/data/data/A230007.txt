        "Also if p=322*10^m-219 is prime then 2*p is in the sequence. 206, 6002 and 6439562 are of this form. It is interesting that 6002 = 2*(3*10^3+1) = 2*(322*10^1-219) is of both two forms.",
        "Let f(r,s,t) = 3*10^(t*(s+4)+2*r+1)+10^(r+1)*(22*(10^(s+2)-1)*(10^(t*(s+4))-1)/ (10^(s+4)-1))+1, if p=f(r,s,t) is prime and (i) r, s and t are nonnegative integers or (ii) s=t=0 and 2r is a positive integer or (iii) r=t=0 and s=-3, then 2*p is in the sequence. Note, very interestingly, this pattern is a generalization of the previous two forms mentioned above. In fact we have 3*10^(m+1)+1 = f(m/2,s,0) and 322*10^m-219 = f(0,m-3,1). - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Dec 17 2013"
