    "comment": [
        "The solid partition graph is constructed as a directed graph whose vertices are solid partitions. The root vertex of the graph is the unique solid partition with one node. Given a solid partition, draw on outward directed edge to all solid partitions that can be obtained by the addition of a single node to the solid partition. The depth of a given vertex is given by the number of its nodes."
