        "In sequence A195061, element 2 through 25 are 1, which means it is possible to find a sum of p=b+c, p is the n-th prime number, the prime factors of b and c traverse all primes smaller than square root p(n). From element 36, the above case does no longer stand for most of primes. However, if you pick two eligible sum p=b1+c1=b2+c2, it becomes possible that the union set of prime factors of b1, c1, b2, and c2 traverse all primes smaller than square root p(n). This stands until p(107)=587. For p(108)=593, no group of two b and cs can have the union set of their prime factors to traverse all primes smaller than square root p(n).  Three groups of b and cs will be needed to do so. And starting from p(284)=1861, four groups are needed for some of the numbers.",
