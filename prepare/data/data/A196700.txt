        "The tribonacci formula arises from considering the number of compositions of n where only the order of parts 1,2,3 matters (part of an upcoming paper), which may be denoted by C(n [4). We are convolving the number of partitions of n with parts >3 with the tribonacci numbers. The number of partitions of n with parts greater than 3 is P(n) - P(n-1) - P(n-2) + P(n-4) + P(n-5) - P(n-6). (Derived from the corresponding gf which is (1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3)gfP(x).) The rest is algebra. It looks like C(n, [4) = P(n) + SUM j=0 to n-3 of P(n-3-j)*A196700(j+1). (End)"
