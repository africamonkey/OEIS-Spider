        "These primes correspond to k = 2, 4, 6, and 8. There are no other primes of this form for k up to 10000. These primes appear in A187614 because the decimal representation of their reciprocal contains only the digits 0, 1, 8, and 9.",
        "Because these numbers are values of the sixth cyclotomic polynomial, by Theorem 1 of Golomb, the only k that can produce primes are the 3-smooth numbers, 2^i*3^j (A003586)."
