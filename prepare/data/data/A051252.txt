        "_Jud McCranie_ reports that he was able to find a solution for each n <= 225 (2n <= 450) in just a few seconds. - Jul 05 2002",
        "Is there a proof that this can always be done?",
        "The Mathematica program for this sequence uses backtracking to find all solutions for a given n. To verify that at least one solution exists for a given n, the backtracking function be made to stop when the first solution is found. Solutions have been found for n <= 48. - _T. D. Noe_, Jun 19 2002",
        "This sequence is from the prime circle problem. There is no known proof that a(n) > 0 for all n. However, for many n (see A072618 and A072676), we can prove that a(n) > 0. Also, the sequence A072616 seems to imply that there are always solutions in which the odd (or even) numbers are in order around the circle. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 01 2002",
        "Prime circles can apparently be generated for any n using the Mathematica programs given in A072676 and A072184. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 08 2002",
        "The following seems to always produce a solution: Work around the circle starting with 1 but after that always choosing the largest remaining number that fits. For example, if n = 4 this gives 1, 6, 7, 4, 3, 8, 5, 2. See A088643 for a sequence on a related idea. - _Paul Boddington_, Oct 30 2007",
