        "Suppose that P is a partition of n.  Let x(1), x(2), ..., x(k) be the distinct parts of P, and let m(i) be the multiplicity of x(i) in P.  Let f(P) be the partition [m(1)*x(1), m(2)*x(2), ... , x(k)*m(k)] of n.  Define c(0,P) = P, c(1,P) = f(P), ..., c(n,P) = f(c(n-1,P), and define d(P) = least n such that c(n,P) has no repeated parts; d(P) is introduced here as the depth of P.  Clearly d(P) = 0 if and only if P is a strict partition, as in A000009.  Conjecture:  the least n that has depth d is 2^n."
