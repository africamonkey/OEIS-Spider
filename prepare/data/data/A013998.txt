        "\"The column Mathematical Recreations by Ian Stewart in the June 1996 issue of Scientific American discusses the Perrin sequence [A001608] A(n) defined by A(0)=3, A(1)=0, A(2)=2, A(n+1)=A(n-1)+A(n-2). Motivated by a theorem of E. Lucas: If n is prime it divides A(n) exactly, the question whether primality of n follows from n divides A(n) exactly was formulated 1899. So far, they say, nobody has found a composite n that divides A(n). Such a number would be called a Perrin pseudoprime. The article quotes an experiment by Steven Arno of the Supercomputing Research Center in Bowie, Md., where a lower bound of 15 digits for the size of the smallest Perrin pseudoprime was obtained in 1991. On Jul 3rd, 1996, I was able to find the two smallest Perrin pseudoprimes:\" [Holzbaur]  - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Nov 30 2001",
        "In the \"Feedback\" section of his column for November 1996, Ian Stewart mentions that _Jeffrey Shallit_ (Waterloo) had written to him saying that he had found the Perrin pseudoprimes 271441 and 904631 in 1982.",
