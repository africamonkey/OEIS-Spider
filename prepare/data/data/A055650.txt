        "I. If p is an odd prime then m=2^n*p is in the sequence iff p=(n+3)*2^n-1. For example, 14, 76, 376, 163712, 3145216, 1073733632,1443108749312 & 67185481812096157153425363042304 are such terms. The numbers n such that (n+3)*2^n-1 is prime up to 10000 are 1, 2, 3, 7, 9,13,18, 50, 210, 301, 349, 1160, 1796, 2677 & 8823. Thus 2^8823*(8826*2^8823-1) is the largest such term that I have found.",
        "II. If m is in the sequence and 3 | d(m)*phi(m) - sigma(m) but 3 doesn't divide m then 3*m is in the sequence. Thus 1, 14, 163712, 277688, 911008, 1080328, 1653520, 1935128 & 4586240 are such terms and 2^2677*(2680*2^2677-1) is the largest such term that I have found. (End)"
