        "The first 5 terms are somewhat arbitrary. The main condition essentially makes sense on the domain where A181942(x) ~ x/((log x) log log x) is increasing, i.e., for x>9. Instead of p>3 one could also put p>n (then the sequence would start 2,3,5,5,7,23,...). Requiring p>2 would yield a(n)=3 for n<30 and then the same sequence from n=30 on. Omitting it altogether would yield a negative r.h.s. for p=2 which therefore would be solution for any n. The currently chosen initial term \"5\" is the least prime in the range of A181942(n)."
