    "comment": [
        "Numbers found by an exhaustive computational search for all solutions. This sequence is complementary to A227116: A227116(n) + A227308(n) = n(n+1)/2.",
        "Up to n=12 there is always a symmetric maximal solution. For n=13 and n=15 symmetric solutions contain at most a(n)-1 painted points. - _Heinrich Ludwig_, Oct 26 2013"
