    "name": "Numerator of the rational coefficient in the main term in the dynamical analog of Mertens' theorem for a full n-dimensional shift, n >= 12 (it is 1 for 2 <= n <= 11).",
    "comment": [
        "b(n) for n >= 2 may be defined as follows. For a full n-dimensional shift, let M(N)=\\sum_{L} O(L)/exp(h[L]) where the sum is over subgroups L of finite index in Z^n, O(L) is the number of points with stabilizer L and exp(h) is the number of symbols.",
        "Then M(N) is asymptotic to a rational times a power of Pi times a product of values of the zeta function at odd integers and b(n) is the numerator of that rational."
