        "A Dyck path of semilength n is a (x,y)-lattice path from (0,0) to (2n,0) that does not go below the x-axis and consists of steps U=(1,1) and D=(1,-1). A peak of a Dyck path is any lattice point visited between two consecutive steps UD.",
        "Number of general rooted ordered trees with n edges and \"back edges\", which are additional edges connecting vertices to their ancestors. Every vertex specifies an ordering on the edges to its children and back edges to its ancestors altogether; it may be connected to the same ancestor by multiple back edges, distinguishable only by their relative ordering under that vertex. - _Li-yao Xia_, Mar 06 2017"
