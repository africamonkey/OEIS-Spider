        "If there are k consecutive natural numbers and all of them are members of A000378, then the maximum value of k is 7. So if we randomly choose 2*7+1 consecutive natural numbers, at least one of them must be member of A004215. This sequence gives the average of 15 consecutive natural numbers in the case there is exactly one member from A004215 in these 15 consecutive natural numbers. In other words, this sequence gives the most isolated terms of A004215.",
