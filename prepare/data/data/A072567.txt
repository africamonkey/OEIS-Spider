        "The growth rate of a(n) is O(n^{3/2}). For a lower bound, take the incidence graph of a finite projective plane. For prime powers q, you get a(q^2+q+1) >= (q+1)(q^2+q+1). For an upper bound, the matrix is an adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph of girth 6. These have at most O(n^{3/2}) edges. - _Peter Shor_, Jul 01 2013",
        "For prime powers q, a(q^2+q+1) is exactly (q+1)(q^2+q+1). It follows from equality case of Reiman inequality. For example, a(21)=105. - _Senya Karpenko_, Jul 23 2014"
