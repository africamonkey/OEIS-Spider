        "A polydrafter is a plane figure formed by joining equal triangles with angles of 30, 60, and 90 degrees with certain restrictions on how they are joined.  See A056842 for details.  One-sided means that distinct mirror images are counted separately.",
        "For odd n, an n-drafter cannot have mirror symmetry, so odd entries in this sequence are double those in A056842."
