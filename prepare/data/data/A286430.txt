        "The water retention model for mathematical surfaces showed that a random two level system will contain more water than a random 3 level system when the size of the square is > 52 X 52. It has also been the subject of Zimmermann's programming contest in 2010 and a wikipedia page as noted below. The number square is a simple environment in which to explore the interaction of volumes, heights, and areas of lakes, ponds, islands, and spillways in the square.",
