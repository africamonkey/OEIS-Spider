        "The sequence gives the number of ways of placing the integers 1, 2, ..., floor(n/2) (with repetition) in n spaces on a circle so that you can jump to every integer exactly once, and the distance you jump is equal to the integer you are currently standing on.",
        "A206344 is a trivial upper bound.",
        "This is the same as A206346, except clock puzzles that are rotations or reflections of each other are counted as distinct."

        "A solvable clock puzzle in the n = 6 case arises from the following integers (placed clockwise around a circle): 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3. If we label the positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then a solution to this puzzle is the following sequence of positions: 0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2."
