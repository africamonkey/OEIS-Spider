    "comment": [
        "The triangular shape T_n has here row length k for row k, for k =1, 2, ..., n. Consider tilings of T_n with n rectangular shapes (i,j),(i < j, i > j,  i=j (square)). The number of possible rectangular shapes (i,j) with n >= i >= j >= 1, which can show up at all in the tiling of T_n (together with their transposed shapes with i interchanged with j) is given as A002620(n+1). See the Dec 09 2014 comment and example by W. Lang there.",
        "The number of such tilings is conjectures to be A000108(n) (Catalan numbers). See the examples in the Catalan number link. For each tiling there is a transposed tiling obtained by mirroring w.r.t. the antidiagonal (SW-NE). A tiling may be self-transposed. E.g., n = 4 has transposed pairs a, m; b, h; x, i; c, g; d, j; e, k; and f, e. Tiling a is (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), tiling m is then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).",
        "For the present sequence not only the transposed tilings are identified but all other tilings with the same rectangular shapes irrespective of the order in (i,j). Thus, in the Catalan link a and m and d and j and e and k and f and e are all identified. E.g., tiling j has tiles (4,1), (1,3), (1.2), (1,1) which is, by taking (1,3) as (3,1), and (1,2) as (2,1) the same as tiling a.",
        "  Tilings c and g are identified with tiling b.",
        "  Therefore, for n=4 there remain only 3 tilings with representatives a, b and x given in the link. They represent 8, 4 and 2 tilings, respectively."
