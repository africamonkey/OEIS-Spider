        "Theorem: If m is in the sequence, sigma(m) is an odd number, 2^n-1 is a prime greater than 3 (a Mersenne prime) and gcd(m, 2^n-1)=1 then m*(2^n-1) is in the sequence (the proof is easy). One of the results of this theorem is: If p=2^n-1 is a prime greater than 3 then 36*p, 288*p, 115200*p and 4147200*p are in the sequence. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Jul 08 2006"
