        "A floretion-generated sequence relating to NSW numbers and numbers n such that (n^2 - 8)/2 is a square. It is also possible to label this sequence as the \"tesfor-transform of the zero-sequence\" under the floretion given in the program code, below. This is because the sequence \"vesseq\" would normally have been A046184 (indices of octagonal numbers which are also a square) using the floretion given. This floretion, however, was purposely \"altered\" in such a way that the sequence \"vesseq\" would turn into A000004. As (a(n)) would not have occurred under \"natural\" circumstances, one could speak of it as the transform of A000004.",
