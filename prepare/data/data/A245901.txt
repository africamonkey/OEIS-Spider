        "The number of permutations of length 2n-1 avoiding 231 in the classical sense which can be realized as labels on an increasing binary tree read in the order they appear in a breadth-first search. (Note that breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree left to right by levels, starting with the root.)",
