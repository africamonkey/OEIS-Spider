For the other direction: Except 3 all twin primes in A181604 are upper twin primes; they cannot be lower twin primes because the upper ones would be multiples of 5. The twin primes in A181604 could be == 3 (mod 30) or == 13 (mod 30) or == 23 (mod 30). The first case is excluded because they would be multiples of 3; the third case is excluded because the lower twin primes would be == 21 (mod 30) and also multiples of 3. So only the case == 13 (mod 30) remains.] - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 14 2017",
