        "Since the formula is being applied twice (once with -5 and once with +5) to each prime generated, each prime may have at most two \"children\". So if p=2, then its children are 6*2-5 = 7 and 6*2+5 = 17. When p=37 there is but one child 6*37+5=227 because 6*37-5=217 which is (7 * 31) and therefore not a prime. Essentially a tree of primes is being built which is at best binary:",

        "The 6p+/-5 tree for the root prime 2 is 7 generations deep and has a population of 28 nodes (including 2 itself).",
        "The choice of 2 as the root of this tree, 6 as the coefficient and 5 as the +/-offset are not arbitrary. Performing this analysis for the first 1,000 primes for all combinations of coefficient (2 to 32) and offset (1 to 31), demonstrates that only 6p+/-5 and 10p+/-3 (see A086322) ever produce a tree with this many nodes on it. All other prime trees are smaller. 4p+/-3 produces a 25 node tree when p=2, 12p+/-5 produces a 22 node tree when p=2 and 28p+/-15 and 30p+/-7 produce 21 node trees when p=953 and 13 respectively.",
        "Note that the most populous tree formed need not be the deepest, since a single generation can produce 1 or 2 children for each parent. The deepest tree is 4p+/-3 which is 11 generations deep when p=2. These results can be viewed at the link provided."
