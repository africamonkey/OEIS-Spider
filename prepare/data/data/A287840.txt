        "Erd\u0151s showed in 1956 how to construct Carmichael numbers from a given number n (typically with many divisors). Given a number n, let P be the set of primes p such that (p-1)|n but p is not a factor of n. Let c be a product of a subset of P with at least 3 elements. If c == 1 (mod n) then c is a Carmichael number.",
