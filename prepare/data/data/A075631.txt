        "Let n be the last term of a group with sum s. The end of the next group is computed by solving x^2 + x - n*(n+1) = 0 (mod 2*s) and picking the smallest solution x > n. For example to find the term after 12 (the (3,4,5) group), solve x^2 + x - 5*6 = 0 (mod 2*12). The solutions are x = {2, 5, 18, 24}; the end of the next group must be 18 and so the next term is Sum[i, i=6 to 18] = 156. - Jonathan Cross (jcross(AT)juggler.net), May 08 2004"
