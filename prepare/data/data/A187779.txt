        "An old conjecture states that the equation prime(n+1)-prime(n)=2m is solvable for m=1/2,1,2,...  . a(n) indicate the smallest term of A014320 such that among the previous terms there occur 1 and all previous even numbers<=a(n). The primes up to 10^8 do not generate any further terms.",
        "According to T. R. Nicely (see Links) the next term, if it exists, must be greater than 1344 and equal to a gap occurring between primes greater than 4*10^18. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jan 06 2013"
