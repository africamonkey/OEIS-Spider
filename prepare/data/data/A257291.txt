        "By \"DFA\" we mean deterministic finite automaton, which must be \"complete\" (that is, a transition must exist for every state).  So the minimal DFA for n = 1 corresponds to a DFA that accepts the string \"10\" and no other.  Four states are required since a \"dead state\" is also needed."
