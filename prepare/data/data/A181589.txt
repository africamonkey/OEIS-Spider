        "The probability P(n) = A000169(n)/A000272(n+1). It is known that lim_{n->inf}p(n) = 1/e. (See Flajolet and Sedgewick link, pp 632, where we can find a function of the number of components k).",
        "Both P(n) and the probability that a permutation on n objects be a derangement tend to 1/e when n rises to infinity. So the events a random forest be a tree and a random permutation be a derangement become equiprobable as n tends to infinity.",
