    "name": "The smallest number in a group of four consecutive mutually coprime integers such that the sum of three of the them plus the square of the fourth is prime.",
    "comment": [
        "Groups of 4 coprime integers (a,b,c,d) are defined by fixing a, then searching for the smallest b>a such that b is coprime to a, searching for the smallest c>b coprime to a and b, then searching for the smallest d>c coprime to a, b and c. If at least one of the 4 sums a^2+b+c+d, a+b^2+c+d, a+b+c^2+d or a+b+c+d^2 is prime, a is in the sequence."

        "The groups of four coprimes increase from 1,2,3,5 as the first group, 2,3,5,7 as the second, 3,4,5,7 as the third and so forth. Each group has four chances of producing a prime by squaring one and adding the rest."
