        "A.   The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL],  given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. Thus, the tower in this case is \"natural\" or \"free\". The solution algorithm producing the sequence is optimal (the sequence presented gives the minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle for the given pre-coloring configuration). Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",
        "B.   Disk numbering is from largest disk (k = 1) to smallest disk (k = N)",
        "C.   The above-listed \"original\" sequence generates a \"partial-sums\" sequence - describing the total number of moves required to solve the puzzle.",
        "D.   Number of moves of disk k, for large k,  is close to (20/33)*3^(k-1) ~ 0.606*3^(k-1). Series designation: P606(k)."
