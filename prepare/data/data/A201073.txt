    "comment": [
        "Prime quintuplets (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12) are one of the two types of densest permissible constellations of 5 primes (A022006 and A022007). Average gaps between prime k-tuples can be deduced from the Hardy-Littlewood k-tuple conjecture and are O(log^k(p)), with k=5 for quintuplets. If a gap is larger than any preceding gap, we call it a maximal gap, or a record gap. Maximal gaps may be significantly larger than average gaps; this sequence suggests that maximal gaps are O(log^6(p)).",
        "A201074 lists initial primes in quintuplets (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12) preceding the maximal gaps. A233432 lists the corresponding primes at the end of the maximal gaps."
