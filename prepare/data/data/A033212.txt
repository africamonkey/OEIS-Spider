        "Theorem: Same as primes of the form x^2+15*y^2 (discriminant -60). Proof: Cox, Cor. 2.27, p. 36.",

        "Three further theorems (these were originally stated as conjectures, but are now known to be theorems, thanks to the work of J. B. Tunnell - see link):",

        "Proof: x (x + y) + c y^2 = odd, therefore x is odd,  x + y odd, so y is even. Let y = 2 t. Then x( x + 2 t) + 4 c t^2 = x^2 + 2 x t  + 4 c t^2 = (x+t)^2 + (4c-1) t^2 = odd. QED With c = 4, neither one represents 2, so x^2+15y^2 and x^2+xy+4y^2 represent the same primes.",
