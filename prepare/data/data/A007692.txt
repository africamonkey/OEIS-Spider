        "For the question that is in the link AskNRICH Archive: It is easy to show that (a^2 + b^2)*(c^2 + d^2) = (a*c + b*d)^2 + (a*d - b*c)^2 = (a*d + b*c)^2 + (a*c - b*d)^2. So terms of this sequence can be generated easily. 5 is the least number of the form a^2 + b^2 where a and b distinct positive integers and this is a list sequence. This is the why we observe that there are many terms which are divisible by 5. - _Altug Alkan_, May 16 2016",
