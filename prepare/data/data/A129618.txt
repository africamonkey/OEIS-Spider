    "name": "A method of using three consecutive coprimes to generate numbers either one away from a prime or splitting two twin primes. The sequence lists the first of a group of three coprimes.",
    "comment": [
        "In 50 trials of trios of consecutive coprimes, nine failed to be within one of a prime; four split twin primes; and 37 were within one of a prime. The results were 37 + 2x4 = 45 prime neighbors from 50 trials. Does this sequence continue to produce primes with a probability greater than mere chance?"

    "formula": [
        "The first group is 1,2,3; the 2nd is 2,3,5; the 3rd is 4,5,7 and so forth as the first number increases by one. Place a group of three coprimes a,b and c into a^2 + b^2 + c to see how close the sum comes to a prime."

        "Take 12,13,17 to yield 12^2 + 13^2 + 17 = 144+169+17=330 which",
        "is one away from the prime 331."
