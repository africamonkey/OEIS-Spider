        ". 1000 in total that do not strictly yield nonnegative values of m of which at least one is a prime. Of the remaining 250 sets, 98 yield a prime value of m (which never exceeds 17) only at a single value of k, and 12 yield prime values of m (not necessarily distinct) at only two values of k. Additionally, one set, S(2, 0, 0, 0, 1), yields m = 2 for every value of k. Aside from the above, it appears that each of the 139 remaining sets produces an infinite number of primes, the smallest of which, for all but six sets, is a 1- or 2-digit prime. The only set for which the smallest prime is larger than 601 is S(2, 1, -2, 2, 2), which generates this sequence of primes, the smallest of which is a(1) = 585691, making this set an extreme outlier, in terms of the smallest prime it generates, among the sets of parameter values described above."
