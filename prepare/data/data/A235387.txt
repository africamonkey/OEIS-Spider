        "The positions reflect radii which are a unique sum of two distinct square integers where order doesn't matter.",
        "The positions are more frequent in occurrence than the positions where the first differences equal -2 because when the radius changes from exactly an integer value k to the open interval (k,k+1), the number of edge squares increases by 2, while in the reverse case, an increase from the open interval (k,k+1) to exactly k+1, the number of edge squares stays the same.  This is in contrast to positions where the first difference equals 1 which are exactly balanced by positions which equal -1 ."

The preceding shift, A235141(8), from squared radius in the interval (4,5) to 5 results in a decrease of two due to the completion of the squares with upper right hand corner coordinates of x=1, y =2 and x=2, y=1 (since 5 = 1^2+2^2)."
