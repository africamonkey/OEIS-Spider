        "A straight-line program is a sequence that starts at 1 and has each entry obtained from two preceding entries by addition, multiplication, or subtraction.  S(n) is the set of integers obtainable at any point in a straight-line program using n steps.  Thus S(0) = {1}, S(1) = {0,1,2}, S(2) = {-1,0,1,2,3,4}; the sequence here is the cardinality of S(n)."
