        "Keith numbers are described in A007629. All powers of 4 appear. However, 2 is the only number of the form 2^n with n odd that appears in the sequence. That's because in negabinary, such numbers are represented as 11 followed by n 0s, and that leads to the sequence 1, 1, 0, ... , 0, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, ... up to 5(2^(n - 2)), and 5(2^(n - 2)) > 2^(n - 1). (See A020714)."
