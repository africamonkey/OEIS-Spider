        "a(n) is the maximum number of turns that player A needs to identify with certainty the location of the coin that player B has hidden in one box in a row of n + 1 boxes. Player A starts by opening one of the boxes to see if the coin is in that box. After that, B secretly relocates the coin from its current box to one of the neighboring boxes, except when n = 1. In that case the game ends before B can relocate the coin. On each turn player A opens one box and when player A can tell in which box the coin is located, the game ends. Can be proved. - _Bob Andriesse_, Dec 22 2017"
