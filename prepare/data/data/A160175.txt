        "a(n) is the number of ways two opposing baseball teams could score a combined total of n runs (tallying the score just prior to each \"batter up!\") considering the order of the scoring as important. Equivalently, a(n) is the number of 2-colored tilings of an n-board with tiles of length at most 4."
