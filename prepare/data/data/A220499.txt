        "For n = 0..3, the number of line segments in the H tree equals the number of toothpicks in the toothpick structure of A139250, so a(n) = 0, if 0 <= n <= 3. Note that there is a correspondence between every element from the two structures. For n = 4 the H tree contains 15 line segments, on the other hand the toothpick structure contains only 11 toothpicks. There are four line segments in the H tree that have no correspondence with the toothpicks of the toothpicks structure. They are the four line segments of the last generation that are closer to the center of the H tree, so a(4) = 4."
