    "comment": [
        "When speaking of inequivalent Boolean functions, three groups of symmetries are typically considered: Complementations only, the Abelian group (2,...,2) of 2^n elements; permutations only, the symmetric group of n! elements; or both complementations and permutations, the octahedral group of 2^n n! elements. In this case only symmetry with respect to the symmetric group is appropriate because complementation affects the property of being a Horn function."
