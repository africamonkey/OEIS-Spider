        "Alternatively, numbers expressible in more than one way as i^2 - ij + j^2, where 1 <= i <= j or 1 <= i < j. The following argument shows that the conditions i <= j or i < j are here equivalent. Note first that i^2 - ij + j^2 = (j - i)^2 - (j - i)*j + j^2, so the only non-duplicated values i^2 - ij + j^2 with 1 <= i < j are when j = 2i, whence i^2 - ij + j^2 = 3i^2. On the other hand, the values with i = j are j^2. There are no integer solutions to 3i^2 = j^2 with i >= 1. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 03 2006",
