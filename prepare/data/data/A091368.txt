    "comment": [
        "Apparently, for primes such that each digit raised to the 4th power sum to a prime, it is more likely that the digits themselves also sum to a prime. In the first 10,000 primes there are 760 primes whose digits raised to the 4th power sum to a prime. Of these, only 106 are such that the sums of the digits are not prime. Interestingly, all of these primes have a digit sum of 25 or 35. Essentially this sequence is the terms of A091367 (primes whose digits raised to the 4th power sum to a prime) that do not also appear in A046704 (primes whose digits sum to a prime)."
