        "The conjectured recursion is correct: For each n count the solutions separately where the last two rows differ in 0, 1, 2, or 3 places; a linear recursion is then readily found. The corresponding matrix has characteristic polynomial x^4 - 2 x^3 - 5 x^2 + 1, matching the recursion recursion a(n+4) = 2a(n+3) + 5a(n+2) - a(n). [From _Hagen von Eitzen_, Oct 21 2009]"
