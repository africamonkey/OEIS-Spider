        "The next 179 terms are all the numbers from 221 to 399. Assuming that '1000' is spelled 'one thousand', the next terms are the numbers in the intervals [x*1000 , x*1000+999] where x runs over all elements a(1),..,a(225) occuring up to there. Then occur all numbers in the intervals [x*10^6, (x+1)*10^6-1], where x again runs over all preceding terms."
