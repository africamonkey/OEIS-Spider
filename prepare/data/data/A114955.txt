        "a(11) = 8 is exact [8^(2/3) + 8^(2/3) = 8.00000000]. It is also a fixed point of this sum of 2/3-power mapping, so that a(n) = 8 for all n>8. This sequence is related to: A112961 \"a cubic Fibonacci sequence\" a(1) = a(2) = 1; for n>2: a(n) = a(n-1)^3 + a(n-2)^3 A112969 \"a quartic Fibonacci sequence\" a(1) = a(2) = 1; for n>2: a(n) = a(n-1)^4 + a(n-2)^4, which is the quartic (or biquadratic) analog of the Fibonacci sequence similarly to A000283 being the quadratic analog of the Fibonacci sequence. Primes in this sequence include a(n) for n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 8. Semiprimes in this sequence include a(n) for n = 4, 6."
