        "59, a prime, in binary is 111011. There is a run of three 1's, followed by a run of one 0, followed by a run of two 1's. There is only one other permutation of these runs that starts with a run of 1's, is followed by a run of the single 0, and finishes with a run of 1s. The other such binary number is 110111, which is 55. Since 55 is composite, then 59 is in this sequence."
