        "Coincides with A072857 up to a(10) = 1079, but then this sequence lists two \"intermediate\" records 1136, 1139, before a(13) = 1237 = A072857(11).",
        "\"With repetition\" means that primes are counted several times if they are obtained from different (not distinct) digits (e.g., 13 is obtained twice from 113), but not if they are obtained as different permutations of the same digits (e.g., p=11 is *not* counted twice even though it results as identical permutation and transposition (2,1) from the digits [1,1]).",
        "The initial a(1)=1 has been chosen for consistency with A072857, it could be argued that it should not be there or listed as a(0).",
        "See A239197 for the record values A075053(a(n)) reached for these numbers which are the indices of the records in A075053."
