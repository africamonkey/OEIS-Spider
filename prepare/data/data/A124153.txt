        "Rossetti and Szczepanski study the family of closed Riemannian n-manifolds with holonomy group isomorphic to (Z_2)^(n-1), which they call generalized Hantzsche-Wendt manifolds. They prove results on their structure, compute some invariants, find relations between them which they illustrate with a graph connecting the family. A flat manifold is a closed Riemannian manifold with zero sectional curvature. From Bieberbach's theorems, we know that in each dimension there are only a finite number of such manifolds (up to affine equivalence) and efforts are underway to classify them. Recently this has been completed up through dimension 6. In dimension 2, the Klein bottle belongs in this family and in dimension 3 there are 3 of them: a classical flat manifold first described by Hantzsche and Wendt (now called \"didicosm\") and 2 nonorientable ones."
