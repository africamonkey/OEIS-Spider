        "Starts with the 5-digit terms listed in A109176: There is no smaller prime of that form, since there is no odd number of that form with less than 3 digits, and those with digits {0,1,2} and {0,1,2,3} (as, e.g., 2013...) are all divisible by 3, thus composite.",
        "For similar reasons, there cannot be terms with the 6 digits {0, ..., 5} or the 7 digits {0, ..., 6} (since 1 + ... + 5 (+ 6) is divisible by 3).",
        "The 8-digit terms a(17)..a(2684) are also listed in A109177 and A109178 (in reverse order). Again, there are no 9- or 10-digit terms (since 0+1+...+8(+9) is divisible by 9). Therefore, the sequence has no terms beyond the 2684 terms < 76543210 listed in the b-file."

The largest odd numbers of the given form below this limit are of the form 7654xyz1 and 7654abc3, with xyz resp. abc permutations of 023 resp. 012.
