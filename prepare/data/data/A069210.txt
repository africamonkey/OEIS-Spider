        "Asymptotically a(n)~C*n with C=0.75854... Is this constant rational?",
        "The constant C=0.75854... is not rational. Otherwise it would imply the rationality of Pi since C=Pi/(Pi+1)=0.7585469930... For n>=6 we have a(n)=(n-1)-k with k>=1 such that ceil(k*(Pi+1)) <= (n-1) < ceil((k+1)*(Pi+1)) = ceil(k*(Pi+1)) + 4 or 5. So n-1 = k*(Pi+1) + O(1) and then: a(n)=(Pi/(Pi + 1))*n + O(1). - Antonio G.
