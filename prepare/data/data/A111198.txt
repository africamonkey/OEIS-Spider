        "That is, the complete sequence A_n, not just the terms that are shown in the entry, does not contain a perfect square or the negative of a perfect square. (In particular, sequences containing 0 or 1 are excluded.)",
        "No more terms up through 130. Does A000131 contain a perfect square?",

        "The first term, 37, refers to the sequence A000037, the nonsquares. All of A000001-A000036 contain obvious square terms.",
        "The second term, 40, refers to A000040, the primes. Obviously any sequence which is a subset of the primes (e.g. A000043) also gives a term."
