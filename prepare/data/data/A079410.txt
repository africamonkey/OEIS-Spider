    "comment": [
        "The lace must pass through each eyelet exactly once, must begin and end at the extreme pair of eyelets and each eyelet must have at least one direct connection to the opposite side. The corresponding sequence including all configs where the lace crosses itself in the space between the eyelet rows is A078698. The only symmetric crossing-free lacing is 1234 for N=2."
