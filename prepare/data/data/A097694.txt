        "For n<=18 an optimal choice and arrangement is of the following form det((n, 6, 2, n-8), (3, n-1, 4, n-5), (n-7, n-6, n-2, 0), (5, 1, n-4, n-3))= 3*n^4-62*n^3+543*n^2-2128*n+3120. For n>18 up to the limit investigated (n<=26) one choice maximizing the determinant is det((n, 6, 2, n-8), (3, n-1, 4, n-5), (n-7, n-6, n-3, 0), (5, 1, n-2, n-4))= 3*n^4-60*n^3+491*n^2-1821*n+2624.
