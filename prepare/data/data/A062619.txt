        "To elaborate on Robert Price's comment that all terms are prime: This is also true for all other sequences of numbers n such that k^n - (k - 1)^n is prime. It is easy to prove by elementary means that if n = a * b, then k^n - (k - 1)^n is divisible by k^(n - a) - (k - 1)^(n - a) and k^(n - b) - (k - 1)^(n - b). - _Alonso del Arte_, Sep 15 2013"
