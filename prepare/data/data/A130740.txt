        "Numbers of the form 2^(4^n) + 5 are divisible by 7. We prove this by induction making use of the expansion (1) a^m - b^m = (a-b)(a^(m-1)+a^(m-2)b +...+ b^(m-1). For n = 1, we have 2^4 + 5 = 21 = 7*3. So the statement is true for n=1. Now assume the statement is true for some integer k and show that it is also true for k+1. Thus we have 2^(4^k) + 5 = 7h for some h. Let 2^(4^(k+1))+ 5 = h1. Now consider the difference h1 - 7h. If this is a multiple of 7 then so is h1. So we have 2^(4^(k+1))+ 5 - (2^(4^k) + 5)) = 16^(4^k)-2^(4^k). This is of the form (1) where n = 4^k, a = 16 and b = 2. So the difference, a^n-b^n is divisible by (a-b) = (16-2) = 14 = 7*2. This implies 2^(4^(k+1)+5 is divisible by 7. So we have assumed the statement was true for k and have shown it to be true for k+1. Therefore by the induction hypothesis, the statement is true for all n."
