        "The n=1 case is degenerate; C(v) = 2 in this case, so a(1)=1. When n=2 we have a degree 4 vertex, and C(v) can take on the values 4, 6, or 8 depending on the angles between the creases, so a(2)=3. In the n=3 (degree 6) case, C(v) can be any of {8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30}. Thus a(3)=7. The possible values of C(v) can be determined by recursive equations found in (Hull, 2002, 2003)."
