        "These primes are important in studying k-imperfect numbers (A127724), see Iannucci-link. Except for the cases p^e = 3 and 8, which yield primes 2 and 5, e is an even number such that e+1 is prime. In fact, except for those two cases, all the primes are of the form (1+p^q)/(1+p), where q is an odd prime; that is, repunit primes with negative prime base."
