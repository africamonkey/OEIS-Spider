        "Consider the Laves tiling of the plane by equilateral pentagons with two 90-degree angles (and all edges equal), with symbol [3^2.4.3.4], as seen for example in Fig. 2.7.1 of Gr\u00fcnbaum and Shephard, p. 96. Sequence gives number of n-celled connected animals that can be drawn on this grid. If we replace this tiling by the square grid tiling [4^4], we get the classical polyomino problem (see A000105). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 17 2006 (from A121193)",
