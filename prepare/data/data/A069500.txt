        "a(5) is greater than 10^23. A naive probabilistic argument suggests that each time the search limit is increased by two orders of magnitude, the chance of finding a(5) is about 1%. The probabilistic argument also suggests that this sequence grows about as fast as the polypowers with base exp(1/2). - _David Wasserman_, Apr 17 2003."
