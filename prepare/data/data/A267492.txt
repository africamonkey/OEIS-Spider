    "comment": [
        "The T operator numerically summarizes the frequency of digits 0 through 3 in that order when they occur in a number. The numbers and the frequency are written in base 4.",
        "These are all autobiographical numbers in base 4 which lead to a fixed-point or belong to a cycle. However, in base 4 there are no cycles of length greater than 1, that is, all the terms are fixed-points."
