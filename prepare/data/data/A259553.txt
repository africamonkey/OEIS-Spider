    "name": "Number of distinct (n!)-tuples, with integer entries between 0 and n, inclusive, where entries measure the length of the longest prefix of each of the n! permutations of 123...n that is a subsequence of some string over the alphabet {1,2,3,...n}.",
    "comment": [
        "This sequence is an upper bound on A259482. (It is only an upper bound because two such n-tuples might be \"equivalent\" in the sense of the Myhill-Nerode theorem.) The length of the shortest string corresponding to (n,n,...,n) is given by A062714."
    ],
    "example": [
        "For n = 2, where the permutations are 12 and 21, the six possible 2-tuples are (0,0) (corresponding to the empty string); (1,0) (corresponding to 1); (0,1) (corresponding to 2); (2,1) (corresponding to 12); (1,2) (corresponding to 21); (2,2) (corresponding to 121)."
