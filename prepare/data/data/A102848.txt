        "A003107 & this sequence are different sequences. A003107 gives the number of partitions in which each part of n is a Fibonacci number, this sequence gives the number of partitions in which the number of parts is a Fibonacci number. Both sequences share the same values for the first 9 values. For example A003107(4) = 4 because of the following 4 partitions of 5: (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1) whereas a(4) is also 4 but because of different set of partitions: (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1)."
