        "The sequence includes an infinite family of arithmetic progressions. Such AP's can be constructed to each term, with large differences [like e.g. square of primorials, A061742]. It is necessary to solve suitable systems of linear Diophantine equations. E.g.: subsequences of triples of terms = {900a+548, 900a+549, 900a+550}=4(225f+137), 9(100f+61), 25(36f+22)}; starting terms in this sequence ={549, 1458, 2358, ...}; difference = A002110(3)^2. - _Labos Elemer_, Nov 25 2002"
