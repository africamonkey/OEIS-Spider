        "This is one of three sequences that partition the positive integers.  In general, suppose that r, s, t are positive real numbers for which the sets {i/r: i>=1}, {j/s: j>=1}, {k/t: k>=1} are pairwise disjoint.  Let a(n) be the rank of n/r when all the numbers in the three sets are jointly ranked.  Define b(n) and c(n) as the ranks of n/s and n/t.  It is easy to prove that",
