        "Starting with 1, each of the rest describes the previous number in a \"digit + number_of_digits\" manner. The odd digits are digits that appeared in the previous term, ordered by the first appearance. The even digits are how many times that digit appeared. In case 10+ of a single digit appears, the number-group in the next term that describes this digit takes up 3+ digits (the \"even digit\" takes up 2+), and each of the digit is considered a single digit when described by the next term."
