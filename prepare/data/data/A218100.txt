        "This is computed as in the comments in A217379, but limited to prime values. The same rationale for declaring that missed records are extremely unlikely holds, but always with the caveat that astronomically rare events do occur.  The power for a(25), having 219 digits, is a full 30 digits longer than that for a(24).  The sequence of exponents is 168, 106, 61, 44, 50, 42, 36, 39, 20, 21, 21, 27, 23, 21, 21, 21, 22, 23, 23, 22, 20, 20, 21 and 24."
