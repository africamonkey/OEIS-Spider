        "A199672 has denominators of upper rational approximants of pi, given by Adam Adamandy Kochanski in 1685. In his 1685 paper \"Observationes cyclometricae\" published in Acta Eruditorum, Adam Adamandy Kochanski presented an approximate ruler-and-compass construction for rectification of the circle. It is not generally known that the first part of this paper included an interesting sequence of rational approximations of pi."
