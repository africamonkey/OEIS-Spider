        "This sequence is interesting as a less constrained form of A261656, or as a 3-prime-factored form of A261658.",
        "Unlike A261656, this sequence has many examples of the b and c of one member being the a and b of another. Two such members of this sequence are 3333=3*11*101 and 13799731 = 11*101*12421. This lets us consider a four factor composite number using both, giving 3*11*101*12421 = 41399193. The sequence of four-factor composites such as this is A261658.",
        "It would be nice to know if, in general, analogous n-factor composites exist."
