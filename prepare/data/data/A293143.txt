        "The carpet is formed by squares within a square grid. The initial term is a(0) = 4 for the corners of the unit square. For n = 1 there are 3 X 3 squares, the middle one being open (empty), with 16 vertex points. At the next stage of recursion, these become eight squares with open center, now based on a square of 10 X 10 points. The remaining center square is empty, missing 4 points, thus the next term is 100 - 4 = 96 for a(2). In the next stage there are 8 squares missing 4 points and the new center is missing 64, thus the 28 square grid now has 784 - 32 - 64 = 688 for a(3). This carpet sequence becomes the faces for the cubes in the Menger Sponge recursion of A293144."
