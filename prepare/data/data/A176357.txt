        "Partial sums of number of equilateral triangles whose vertices (whether connected by lines or not) lie at intersection points resulting from drawing lines connecting every pair of vertices of a regular 3n-gon (and extending beyond the polygon). The subsequence of primes in this partial sum begins: 127, x."
