    "comment": [
        "A Szasz groupoid (S,*) is one for which there is exactly one ordered triple (a,b,c) of members of S that does not associate:  (a*b)*c != a*(b*c).  For any other triple (x,y,z), we have (x*y)*z = x*(y*z).  Thus, a Szasz groupoid is as close to being a semigroup as possible, without actually being associative.  G. Szasz proved that such groupoids exist on any set with at least four members.  Every Szasz groupoid is non-commutative."

    "example": [
        "The \"smallest\" Szasz groupoid of order 3 with elements {a,b,c} defines c*b = b, and the product of every other pair of elements is defined to be a. Then, (c*c)*b = a*b = b but c*(c*b) = c*b = b, but every triple other than (c,c,b) associates."
