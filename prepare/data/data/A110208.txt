        "First differences are the sequence of semiprimes (A001358). Hence a(n) is the least positive sequence whose first differences are the sequence of semiprimes. Primes in this sequence include: a(1) = 5, a(2) = 11, a(6) = 59, a(9) = 127, a(14) = 293, a(33) = 1613. Semiprimes in this sequence include: a(17) = 427 = 7 * 61, a(18) = 478 = 2 * 239, a(19) = 533 = 13 * 41, a(26) = 995 = 5 * 199, a(27) = 1077 = 3 * 359, a(35) = 1814 = 2 * 907, a(42) = 2643 = 3 * 881, a(45) = 3039 = 3 * 1013."
