        "For the proof for the first a(n) formula given below use the curvature c1(n) = (1 + S(n, 18) - 9*S(n-1, 18))/2  (see the W. Lang link in A240926, part I) in c(n) from Descartes' formula and compare it with a(n) in c(n) = (4/5)*(2*(a(n) + 2) + a(n)  *(1+sqrt(5))/2). This can be done by using standard S-polynomial identities like the three term recurrence for S(n+1, 18) and the Cassini-Simson type identity (see a comment on A246638) which implies the formula S(n, 18)*S(n-1, 18) = (-1 + S(n, 18)^2 + S(n-1, 18)^2)/18.
