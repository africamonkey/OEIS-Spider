        "Although there are 78498 primes < 10^6, only 3030 primes are required to form all even numbers < 10^6. There are 10581, 36308 and 123139 of these primes less than 10^7, 10^8 and 10^9, respectively. The asymptotic density of these primes appears to be 0. The number of these primes < x is roughly 0.85 sqrt(x log(x)).",
