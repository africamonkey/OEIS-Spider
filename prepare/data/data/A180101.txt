        "For the purposes of this paragraph, regard 0 as the (-1)st prime and 1 as the 0th prime. Conjectures: All primes appear; the primes appear in increasing order;  the k-th prime p(k) appears p(k+1)-p(k-1) times (cf. A031131); and p(k) appears for the first time at position A164653(k) (sums of two consecutive primes). These assertions are stated as conjectures only because I have not written out a formal proof, but they are surely true."
