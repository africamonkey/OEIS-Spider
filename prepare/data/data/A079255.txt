The sequence satisfies the meta-system for n>=2: a(a(n))=2*a(n)+2*n+2 ; a(a(n)-1)=2*a(n)+2*n-1 ; a(a(n)-2)=2*a(n)+2*n-4 which allows us to have all terms since first differences =2 or 3 only. a(n)=a(n-1)+3 if n is in A026363, a(n)=a(n-1)+2 otherwise (if n is in A026364). - _Benoit Cloitre_, Apr 23 2008"
