    "comment": [
        "The sequence is conjectural. It depends on a proof of conjecture 1: If condition (*) holds for k and n < u(k), then it holds for k+1 and n, where u(k) is some nondecreasing function of k. Computationally this is confirmed for 1 < k < 300 and n < 100, 2 < k < 250 and n < 238, 3 < k < 250 and n < 282, 5 < k < 200 and n < 652, 8 < k < 200 and n < 2088, 9 < k < 200 and n <= 1000000.",
        "No further terms up to 1000000 were found; this suggests conjecture 2: The sequence is finite and 1848 its last term. Perhaps easier to prove is the stronger conjecture 3: For every n > c there is a k < d such that condition (*) is violated for k and n. Computationally this is confirmed for n <=1000000 and c = 1848, d = 11."
