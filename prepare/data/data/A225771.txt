Chema, May 08 2017 (Start): Also gives the body diagonals of all primitive Pythagorean quadruples that define square prisms, with sides [b, b, and c] and diagonal d, such that 2*b^2 + c^2 = d^2. E.g., sides [2, 2, 1], diagonal 3 = a(2); [4, 4, 7], 9 = a(3); [6, 6, 7], 11 = a(4); [12, 12, 1], 17 = a(5); [6, 6, 17] 19 = a(6); [10, 10, 23], 27 = a(7); [20, 20, 17], 33 = a(8); [24, 24, 23], 41  = a(9)...
