        "Archimedes' spiral with polar equation r=ca (c>0; a is the angle) defines a family of permutations: 1 is placed at the origin of the XY-plane and each time, as a increases, that r hits the X-axis we put the next number on the X-axis; reading the numbers from left to right yields the permutation of 1..N (N>=2): N N-2 ... 6 4 2 1 3 5 ... N-3 N-1 (N is even), N-1 N-3 ... 6 4 2 1 3 5 ... N-1 N (N is odd). N is A_0-prime if this permutation consists of a single cycle of length N. So all A_0-primes are even.",
        "No formula is known for a(n): the A_0-primes have been found by exhaustive search. But we have: (1) N is A_0-prime iff N is even, p=2N+1 is a prime number and both +2 and -2 generate Z_p^* (the multiplicative group of Z_p); (2) N is A_0-prime iff N=2 (mod 4), p=2N+1 is a prime number and both +2 and -2 generate Z_p^*."
