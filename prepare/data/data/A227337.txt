        "The 2n first divisors of a(n) = k are of the form {1, 2, c(1), p(1), c(2), p(2), ..., c(n), p(n)} where c(i) are composite divisors and p(i) are prime divisors with k = 4*p(1)*p(2)*...*p(n). Suppose the (2*n+1)-th and the (2n+2)-th divisor of k are composite numbers c(n+1) and c(n+2), so we have two cases:",
        "Case 1: if there exists a prime number p(n+1) such that c(n+1) < p(n+1) < c(n+2), then a(n+1) = a(n)*p(n+1);",
        "Case 2: if no such prime exists, it is necessary to consider a'(n) = 4*p'(1)*p'(2)*...*p'(n) such that there exist two composites c'(n+1) and c'(n+2) where c'(n+1) < p'(n+1) < c'(n+2), and a(n+1) = a'(n)* p'(n+1).",

The smallest prime between the two next divisors, 26 and 46, is 29. So a(5) = 4*5*13*23*29.",

But no prime exists between the two next divisors, 20 and 22. We consider a'(3) = 4*5*13 with the divisors {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 13, 20, 26, 52, 65, 130, 260} with 3 couples (nonprime, prime) = (1, 2), (4, 5), (10, 13) => there exits the prime 23 between the two next divisors, 20 and 26.
