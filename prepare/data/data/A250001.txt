        "Two arrangements are considered the same if one can be continuously changed to the other while keeping all circles circular (although the radii may be continuously changed), without changing the multiplicity of intersection points, and without a circle passing through an intersection point. Turning the whole configuration over is allowed.",

        "Comment from _Jon Wild_, Aug 25 2016.  Once you get to n=5, geometric concerns mean that not all topologically-conceivable arrangements are actually circle-drawable.  My program enumerated 16977 conceivable arrangements of 5 pseudo-circles, and Christopher Jones and I together have figured out how to show that 26 of these arrangements are not actually circle-drawable. So it seems that a(5) = 16951. This entry will be updated soon, and there will be a new sequence for the number of topologically-conceivable arrangements. [The counts in this comment were amended by _Jon Wild_ on Aug 30 2016. I apologize for taking so long to make the corrections here. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 11 2017]"
