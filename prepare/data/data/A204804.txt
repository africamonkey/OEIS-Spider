        "Free: none is a rigid transformation (translation, rotation, reflection or glide reflection) of another.  Tree-like: never does a 2x2 subarrangement of squares occur in the shape. So the dual graph is a tree. Convex: every horizontal, or vertical line, meets the shape in either a single segment, or not at all."
