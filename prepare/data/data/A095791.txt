    "comment": [
        "The lazy Fibonacci representation of n >= 0 is obtained by replacing every string of 0's in the binary representation of n by a single 0, thus obtaining a finite zero-one sequence (d(2), d(3), d(4), ..., d(k)), and then forming d(2)*F(2) + d(3)*F(3) + ... + d(k)*F(k), as in the Mathematica program. The lazy Fibonacci representation is often called the maximal Fibonacci representation, in contrast to the Zeckendorf representation, also called the minimal Fibonacci representation. - _Clark Kimberling_, Mar 04 2015",
        "Regarding the References, the lazy Fibonacci representation is sometimes attributed to Erd\u0151s and Joo, but it is also found in Brown and Ferns. - _Clark Kimberling_, Mar 04 2015"
