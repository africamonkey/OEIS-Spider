        "2999 = A062802(4) is the smallest term of this sequence for which the second iterated sum of digits is not the final sum; i.e. the smallest requiring three summations (2+9+9+9=29, 2+9=11, 1+1=2 and all three sums are prime). (The corresponding statement about the very large A062802(5) is not true because a large number of smaller nonprimes of the same digit length also have the digit sum 2999, the least being 29999..., where 333 9's follow the 2.). A062802, a sequence of primes, is a subsequence of this sequence and of A070027.",
