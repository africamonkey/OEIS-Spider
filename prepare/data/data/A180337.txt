    "comment": [
        "I conjecture, but have not been able to prove, that this sequence is finite with only the terms given above. In that case it can be constructed by taking a1=2, and adjoining all numbers aj*ak + 1, where aj and ak are two prime members of the sequence.",
        "Any number which can be expressed as p*q + 1, where p is prime and q does not belong to the sequence, does not belong to the sequence either."
    ],
    "example": [
        "8 is not a member of the sequence since it is equal to 1 + 7. 9 is not a member of the sequence since it can be written 1 + 2 + 2*3. 10 is not a member of the sequence since it is equal to 1 + 3 + 3*2. 11 is a member of the sequence. If 11 could be written in this form, then p1 must divide 10. We would have 11 = 1 + p1(1 + p2 + ..), which would imply that 5 is a member of the sequence if p1 = 2, or vice versa. Since neither 2 nor 5 is a member, nor is 11."
