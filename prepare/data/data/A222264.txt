        "If the number x is a prime which does not divide n, then n*x is a perfect number. This happens (so far) only when x = 2n-1 = 2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime (cf. A000043). But if x does not divide n, as, e.g., for (n,x)=(10,9), then n*x is a so-called freestyle perfect number, cf. A058007: Namely it \"would be perfect if x is assumed to be prime\", which means that sigma(n*x) is replaced by sigma(n)*(x+1) in the relation 2P=sigma(P) characterizing perfect numbers P, listed in A000396.",
