        "Seems to tend towards 2^(n + 0.4891533...); replacing \"prime\" with \"number\" or \"power of 2\" and starting with a(0)=1, it would be 2^n; with primes starting with a(1)=2 but no a(0), it seems as if it could tend towards 2^(n - 0.07323...); while with squares starting with a(0)=0 it seems as if it would tend towards 2^(n + 0.4294...); it seems plausible that all such sequences have similar properties provided that the underlying sequence is increasing but no faster than 2^n."
