        "On the infinite square grid we start with no toothpicks.",
        "At stage 1, we place a cross, centered at the origin, formed by 2 vertical toothpicks and 2 horizontal toothpicks of length 1. At stage 2, we place 8 D-toothpicks of length sqrt(2). At stage 3, we place 16 toothpicks of length 1. And so on.",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage. The first differences (A194433) give the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks added at n-th stage.",
        "Apparently this cellular automaton has a fractal behavior (or like-fractal behavior) related to power of 2, similar to A194270 and very similar to A194434. The octagonal structure contains a large number of distinct polygonal shapes. For more information see A194270, A194440 and A194442."
