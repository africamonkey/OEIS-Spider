        "The sequence a(0)=0, a(1)=2, a(2)=8, a(3)=32, ... arises as the number of quadruples (w,x,y,z) with all terms in {0,...,n} and w-x, x-y, and y-z all odd. For a guide to related sequences, see A211795.",
        "The sequence a(3)=2, a(4)=8, a(5)=32, ... is the number of L3 configurations in an n X n permutation array. An L3 configuration is defined to be a set of 3 equally-spaced, collinear points in a permutation array.  L3 configurations were first enumerated by Davies in his study of the density of Costas arrays. They constitute a violation of the definition of a Costas array, so Costas arrays cannot have any. Davies's work went unpublished until it appeared in the survey paper by Drakakis. - _Bill Correll, Jr._, Jun 07 2014",
