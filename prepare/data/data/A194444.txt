        "This cellular automaton has essentially the same rules as A194270. We start at stage 0 with no toothpicks. At stage 1, we place a D-toothpick of length sqrt(2), in diagonal direction, at (0,0),(1,1). At stage 2, we place two toothpicks of length 1. At stage 3 we place four D-toothpicks. And so on. The toothpicks and D-toothpicks are connected by their endpoints. The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage. The first differences (A194445) give the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage. It appears that the structure shows a fractal (or like-fractal) behavior.",
