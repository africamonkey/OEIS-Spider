        "Note that beads with different colors are always present. This is in contrast to, e.g., A000029, where not only representatives but also one-color bracelets are counted. This sequences gives the number of binary bracelets with at least as many 0's as 1's and at least one 1 (bracelet analog of A226881). The number of two-color bracelets up to permutations of colors is given by A056357. For odd n these two sequences are equal. For a(8), the bracelets 00011011 and 11100100 are equivalent in A056357 but distinct in this sequence. - _Andrew Howroyd_ and _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 25 2017"
