        "Previous name was: If A = {a_1, a_2, a_3...} is the Moser-de Bruijn sequence A000695 (consisting of sums of distinct powers of 4) and A' = {2a_1, 2a_2, 2a_3...} then this sequence, let's call it B, is the union of A and A'. Its significance, alluded to in the entry for the Moser-de Bruijn sequence, is that its sumset, B+B, = {b_i + b_j : i, j natural numbers} consists of the nonnegative integers; and it is the fastest-growing sequence with this property. It can also be described as a \"basis of order two for the nonnegative integers\".",
