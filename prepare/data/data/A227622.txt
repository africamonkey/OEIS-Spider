        "Orders for which residues mod p of the form x^i, i congruent to 0, 1, or 3 (mod 6), form a difference set with parameters (v,k,lambda)=(p,(p-1)/2,(p-3)/4), where x is a primitive root such that 3=x^j, with j congruent to 1 (mod 6). This construction is due to Marshall Hall. Such a difference set has the same parameters as the difference set formed by quadratic residues, that is, the Paley difference set, but is not equivalent to it. Both difference sets give rise to Hadamard matrices of size p+1."
