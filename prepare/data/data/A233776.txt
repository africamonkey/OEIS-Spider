        "Note that both the structure mentioned in the above comment and the structure mentioned in the definition are essentially equivalents. Both structures are related to the Sierpinski triangle (see A047999). The number of edges in the structure after n-th stage is A006046(n). The number of edges added at n-th stage is A001316(n-1), for n >= 1 (see example)."
