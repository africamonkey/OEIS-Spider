        "This is to the tribonacci sequence as A055502 is to the Fibonacci sequence (i.e. least prime greater than the sum of the previous 2 terms in A055502, least prime greater than the sum of the previous 3 terms in this sequence). The first 9 positive terms are also elements of A089189 (primes p such that p-1 is cube- or higher power-free) but that coiuncidence breaks down as a(10) = 617 is a prime p, but p-1 = 616 = 2^3 * 7 * 11 is not cubefree."
