        "x is an element of this sequence if when m is the least natural number such that the least positive residue of x mod m! is no more than (m-2)!, Floor[x/(m!)] is congruent to m-1 mod m and Floor[x/(m*(m!))] is not congruent to m-1 mod m. The sequence is made up of the residue classes 3 mod 8; 14 and 32 mod 54; 76, 78, 172, 174, 268 and 270 mod 384, etc. A set of such sequences with entries for each zeta(k) - 1 partitions the integers. See the linked paper for their construction."
