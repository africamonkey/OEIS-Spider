        "Algebraically, y solutions = {1, 3, 7, 29, 6761} can be derived from x solutions as follows: y = sqrt(((2*x^2 - 1)^2 + 5)/6). From this relationship it becomes clear that the form (((2*x^2 - 1)^2 + 5)/6) can only be an integer square for x is in {1, 2, 3, 6, 91}. Thus, x and y solutions are also unique integer solutions to the following equivalency: (2x^2 - 1)^2  = 6y^2 - 5. From this relationship the following statement naturally follows: ((sqrt(6*y^2 - 5) + 1)/2 - sqrt((sqrt(6*(y^2) - 5) + 1)/2))/2 = (2^z - 1) = {0, 1, 3, 15, 4095} = A076046(n), the Ramanujan-Nagell triangular numbers; z = {0, 1, 2, 4, 12} = (A060728(n) - 3). - _Raphie Frank_, Jun 26 2013"
