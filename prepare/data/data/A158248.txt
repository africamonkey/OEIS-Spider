        "One interesting thing about these numbers is that an exact root can always be taken of each. For example, 49 is 7 squared, 289 is 17 squared, 343 is 7 cubed, 361 is 19 squared, 529 is 23 squared. The other interesting property is that each root such as 7, 17, 19, 23 when the reciprocal is taken is a long period prime such that for 1/m the period is m - 1. All long period primes are generated by this process.",
        "This sequence was generated by a program that generates the repeating fraction and then searches all repeating fractions generated to satisfy the criterion that the period is > n/2, but less than n - 1.",
        "When I first generated this sequence, I had thought that every number from A001913 when squared, cubed, etc. would be a member of this sequence. However, I have found that for 487, a member of A001913, that the reciprocal of 487^2 = 237169, is 486, rather than a number between 237169/2 and 237169 - 1. 487 is the only number I have found that does not conform to the property of this sequence for the first 1000 terms of A001913. - _Robert Hutchins_, Jun 14 2013",
