        "Then must follow a term >= 12 + 11 = 23 since the concatenation of the first two digits will be at least 11, but 23 would yield 12 for the concatenation, not equal to the gap. For a(3) = 24 the same concatenation is equal to the gap.",
        "After a(25)=1013, and also after a(282)=10044, there follow many gaps of 11, then, e.g. after a(1187)=19999, one gap of 12 followed by about 450 gaps of 22, then one gap of 23 and about 300 gaps of 33, etc. After about 100 gaps of 99 the sequence reaches a(2850) = 99911, followed by a gap of 91, and then again more than 9000 gaps of 11.",
