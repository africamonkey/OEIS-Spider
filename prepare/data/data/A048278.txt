To quote Granville and Ramar\u00e9, \"From Theorem 2 it is evident that there are only finitely many rows of Pascal's Triangle in which all of the entries are squarefree. In section 2 we show that this only occurs in rows 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 23 (a result proved by Erd\u0151s long ago).\" - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 06 2014",
