        "It would be more natural to include the empty substring, which would result in the sequence b(n)=a(n)+1; all values computed so far confirm the conjecture that a(n)+1 = A006697(n). - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 17 2007",
        "In addition to the example given, computation finds 17 other binary strings of length 6 which contain the maximal number a(6)=16 of distinct substrings. Interestingly, each of the 18 such instances gives the same numbers of substrings of each possible length, in this case 2,4,4,3,2,1 substrings of lengths 1 through 6, respectively.",
        "Calculations suggest that, for any n>0, binary strings of length n exist such that the number of distinct substrings of length k, 1<=k<=n, is as large as possible consistent with basic counting principles, i.e., n-k+1 substrings of length k starting at each of the n-k+1 possible starting positions, subject to the condition, however, that there cannot be more than 2^k distinct binary strings of length k. This suggests the following conjecture. Conjecture: The maximum number a(n) of distinct substrings of a binary string of length n is given by a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} t(k) where t(k) is the smaller of 2^k and n-k+1.",
        "Conjecture: a(n) = A006697(n)-1. - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Sep 19 2005",
        "Conjecture: a(n) = 2^(m+1)-2 + (n-m)(n-m+1)/2, where m = floor(n+1-LambertW( 2^(n+1) * log(2) ) / log(2) ) = integer part of the solution to 2^x = n+1-x. This is based on the reasoning that you can construct the word of length n so that it contains the maximal possible number, max( n-k+1, 2^k ), of different substrings of length k. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 17 2007",
