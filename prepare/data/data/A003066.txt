        "From _Dean Hickerson_, Jan 13 2003: (Start)",
        "Suppose you have a list of the first n prime numbers p_1, ..., p_n and you want to estimate the next one. The probability that a random integer is not divisible by any of p_1, ..., p_n is (1-1/p_1) * ... * (1-1/p_n). In other words, 1 out of every 1/((1-1/p_1) * ... * (1-1/p_n)) integers is relatively prime to p_1, ..., p_n.",
        "So we might expect the next prime to be roughly this much larger than p_n; i.e. p_(n+1) may be about p_n + 1/((1-1/p_1) * ... * (1-1/p_n)). This sequence and A003067, A003068 are obtained by replacing this approximation by an exact equation, using 3 different ways of making the results integers. (End)"
