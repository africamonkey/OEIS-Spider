        "Because A058369 (with offset 1) is a subsequence, this sequence is infinite.",
        "Conjecture: The relative complement of A058369 with respect to this sequence is infinite. That is, there are infinitely many n such that the digit sum of n^2 is a proper divisor of the digit sum of n.",
        "If the digit sum of n^2 is a proper divisor of the digit sum of n, then this property holds for 10*n as well, i.e. the digit sum of n = 149*10^k has as a proper divisor the digit sum of n^2 for all k > 0. Are there infinitely many n that are not a multiple of 10 such that the digit sum of n^2 is a proper divisor of the digit sum of n? The first few such numbers are: 149, 549, 1049, 14499, 19499, 55679, 59499, 64499, 73499, 118499, 144999, 145949, 179249, 244949, 244998, 334679, 347855, 473499, 548735, 549549, 549639, 556965, 837855, ... - _Chai Wah Wu_, Mar 16 2016"
