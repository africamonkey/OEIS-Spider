        "This sequence is mentioned in the paper by Richard Guy, in which he reports on unsolved problems. This problem came from Mario Borelli and Cecil B. Mast. The paper poses two questions about these numbers: (1) Can palindromic or nonpalindromic primes be otherwise characterized? and (2) What is the cardinality, or the density, of the set of palindromic primes? Of the set of nonpalindromic primes? - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 17 2011"
