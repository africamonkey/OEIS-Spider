    "comment": [
        "Imagine that each digit of n is on a wheel on a combination lock and each wheel is being rotated two notches for each application of the function. Thus for the digits 0 to 7, the replacement digit is simply the digit+2, but for 8 the replacement digit is 0 and for 9 the replacement digit is 1. Thus 227 -> 449 -> 661 -> 883 -> 5 (initial zeros are dropped on results.) Note: 227, 86627 and 86664427 also work for *five* successive applications of the function. I have not found any primes that work for six applications of the function."
