        "More generally, the numbers which are not the sum of k-th powers larger than 1 are exactly those in [1,6^k-3^k-2^k] but not of the form 2^k.a+3^k.b+5^k.c with a,b,c nonnegative. This relies on the following fact applied to m=2^k and n=3^k: if m and n are relatively prime, then the largest number which is not a linear combination of m and n with positive integer coefficients is mn-m-n. - _Benoit Jubin_, Jun 29 2010"
