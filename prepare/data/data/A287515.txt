        "A167500 lists the positions of 1s when the sequence is written in binary. This sequence lists the positions of 0s. When written in binary, it begins 10, 111, 1000, 1001, 1011... The first 0 appears at position 2, so a(1) = 2 = 10. The second 0 appears at position 7, so a(2) = 7 = 111. The third 0 appears at position 8, so a(3) = 8 = 1000. The sequence then becomes self-generating, because entries are added to it faster than 0s are detected in it."
