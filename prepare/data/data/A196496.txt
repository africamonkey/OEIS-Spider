        "The centered k-gonal numbers are defined in trottermath.net as (k*n^2-k*n+2)/2, and elsewhere with a slightly different standard index n as (k*n^2+k*n+2)/2. The centered 37-gonal numbers are 1, 38, 112, 223, 371, 556, 778,.... A086272(36,n), where A086272 uses yet another index convention for k. The sequence is generated by centered 37-gonal numbers with standard indices n=1, 377, 2399, 407156,..."
