    "comment": [
        "Many numbers become prime by appending a one-digit odd number. Some numbers (such as 20, 32, 51, etc.) require a 2-digit odd number (A032352 has these). In the first 100,000 values of n there are only 22 that require a 3-digit odd number. There probably are some values that require odd numbers of 4 or more digits, but these are likely to be very large."

    "example": [
        "a(1)=16557 because 16557 is first number which requires a 3-digit odd number be appended to it to form a prime. 165571, 165573, 165575, ..., 165579, 1655711, 1655713, ..., 1655799 are all nonprime numbers. 16557103 is the first prime formed by appending odd numbers to 16657. a(2) = 16718 because 16718111 is the first prime formed by appending odd numbers to 16718."
