        "In the limit, the growth rate is 1.61575... per generation as opposed to 1.61803... for Fibonacci numbers. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 22 2009",
        "If the rabbits die after 12 months, then those who were there in month 1 should die in month 13, whence a(13) = 144 + 89 - 1 = 232 and not 233. In month 14, no rabbits die because the only pair which was there in month 2 already dies. Then in month 15, the one pair born in month 3 will die. In general, the number of rabbits which die in month n (because they are aged 12 months) is equal to the number of newborn rabbits in month n - 12, which is the number of rabbits present in month n - 14. (Recall that a(n - 12) = a(n - 13) + a(n - 14) - #(dying rabbits) = #(rabbits from previous month) + #(newborn rabbits) - #(dying rabbits).) So the recurrence should read a(n) = a(n - 1) + a(n - 2) - a(n - 14). - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 06 2017"
