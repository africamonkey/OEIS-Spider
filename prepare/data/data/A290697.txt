        "a(4)=1. A dissection into 5 triangles is impossible.",
        "The size of the smallest triangle is 1 for triangles with maximum ratio of sizes between largest and smallest triangle for all n <= 20. If dissections with maximum size of largest occurring triangle and size of smallest triangle > 1 are found for larger n, there might be different configurations leading to a maximum ratio between largest and smallest side having a shorter largest side than the one provided as a(n). If this situation occurs for any n > 20, it shall be indicated in a corresponding comment."
