    "comment": [
        "A008284(m,n) is the number of partitions of the integer m into n parts; p(m,n) in the following. It is numerically and intuitively clear that for any fixed n, for sufficiently large m, p(m,n+1) > p(m,n).  Moreover, from examining the table of p(m,n) for small values of n, it appears that for any fixed n, once it has occurred for some m that p(m,n+1) > p(m,n), then it holds for all larger m. However, I did not see a simple proof of this, nor could I easily find one on the net. Presuming it is true, then the m at which p(m,n+1) first overtakes p(m,n) is of intrinsic interest."
