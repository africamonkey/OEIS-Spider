        "Pi progresses as 3, 31, 314, 3141, hence minimal prime numbers that do this are 3, 31, 13147, 73141. While there are other primes that contain, say, 314, the prime number, 13147 is the first prime to do so.",
        "It is probably provable that this is an infinite sequence. Notice that 314159 appears twice in the sequence since 314159 is the smallest prime that contains 31415 as well as 314159.",
        "a(n) exists for all n since for sufficiently large k, the k-th prime gap < prime(k)^d for some d < 1, so for a fixed number a, the next prime after a*10^m will be less than (a+1)*10^m for sufficiently large m and thus contain a as a substring. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Feb 22 2018"
