    "comment": [
        "In computing Li(x) we can limit the iterations to 2*log(x) + m where m is suitably large to allow convergence to the precision desired. If we let m = floor(log(log(x))) we get a better approximation of Pi(x) than the full Li(x) expansion. With this m we get Li(x) < Pi(x) often but still closer in absolute value to Pi(x). Note the use of the gamma function to quickly compute factorials in the precision range i.e. gamma(x+1) = x!.",

        "The logarithmic Integral can be computed by Li(x) = log(log(x)) + log(x) + log(x)^2/2/2! + log(x)^3/3/3! + ... + 1 - log(3/2) - sum(k=1, prec, (zeta(2k+1)-1)/(2k+1)/4^k). This last expression is a fast converging series taken from the link for the Euler-Mascheroni constant 0.57721.. where prec is the precision level you are using. PARI has an Euler() function built in so that was used in this calculation."
