        "For all such b(i) sequences there is a value of i = Nmax, such that for i<=Nmax the sequence produces integers and for i > Nmax the sequence produces rational non-integers. Thus the \"length\" of the integer portion of b(i) is Nmax + 1 (when including b(0)).",
        "Nmax is a function of the integer k > 0, written as Nmax(k).",
