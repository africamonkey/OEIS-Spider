        "A straight-line program is a sequence that starts at 1 and has each entry obtained from two preceding entries by addition, multiplication, or subtraction. This sequence lists the smallest number of steps needed to reach n!. A 10-step solution for 12 is {1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 30, 720, 900, 924, 518400, 12!}, found by Stan Wagon; John Guilford found all such, and proved that 10 is minimal for 12! - edited by Stan Wagon, Nov 07 2012",
        "This sequence describes the difficulty of computing the factorial in Valiant's model. If it is of polynomial growth -- that is, there exists some c such that a(n) < (log n)^c for all n -- then the factorial is said to be easy to compute, and consequently \"the Hilbert Nullstellensatz is intractable, and consequently the algebraic version of 'NP != P' is true\" (Shub & Smale). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 24 2012",
        "During Al Zimmermann's contest (see link), Ed Mertensotto generated all sequences of 12 steps and found no better solutions. Hence a(13)-a(17) are optimal. Solutions of 13 steps were found for a(18) and a(19) during the contest. Hence, they are optimal too. - Dmitry Kamenetsky, Apr 22 2013"
