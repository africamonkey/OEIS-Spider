        "Answer: yes. These are the positions of 1 in A188472, which is obtained from A188017 by applying [-x]=-[x]-1 to [6r-nr], where [.] is the floor function, and r the golden mean. The extra 6 is explained by noting that  [-x]=-[x]-1 does not hold for integer x. - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 15 2016"
