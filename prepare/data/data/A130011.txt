        "It is not clear in what sense \"slowest increasing\" is meant in the description of this sequence. The definition requires that there be exactly a(k) terms <= 3 a(k), for any index k. Therefore, a(n+1) > 3n for all indices n of the form n = a(k). Thus, any such sequence has an infinite number of terms a(k) >= 3k-2. The lexicographically first variant A260107, which starts (1, 4, 5, 6, 13, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, ...), also has all its terms a(k) <= 3k-2, so it cannot be said to increase faster. - _M. F.
