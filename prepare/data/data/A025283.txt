        "Here exponents equal to 1 are not taken into account, so 1255 = 5^1*251^1 = 5*251 is a term. Prime numbers are excluded because they all trivially use the same digits as their prime factorization. If, on the contrary, exponents equal to 1 are counted, the resulting sequence is A075047. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jul 14 2015",
        "An interesting example of the factorization digits appearing in the same order as in its composite generator: 13532385396179 = 13 * 53^2 * 3853 * 96179. - _Hans Havermann_, Jun 28 2017"
