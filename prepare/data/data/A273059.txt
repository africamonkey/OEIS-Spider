        "What is the reason for the three \"lines\" in the graph of first differences (see link, also A275915)?",
        "Apparently they are related to the fact that \"ones\" are concentrated along two main diagonals of the spiral A274640, see the graph \"Spiral A274640 with ones shown\".",
        "This is the Greedy Queens construction on a spiral (cf. A065188). Follow a counterclockwise spiral starting at the origin, and place a queen iff it is not attacked by any existing queen. This same problem is described in a different but equivalent way in A140100 and A140101. See A140101 for a conjectured recurrence which underlies all these sequences. - _N. J. A.
