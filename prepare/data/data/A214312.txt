        "Each 4 part partition of n, with the parts written in nonincreasing order, defines a color signature. For a given color signature, say  [p[1], p[2], p[3], p[4]], with p[1] >= p[2]  >= p[3] >= p[4] >= 1, there are A213941(n,k)= A035206(n,k)*A213939(n,k) bracelets if this signature corresponds (with the order of the parts reversed) to the k-th partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) order. See A213941 for more details. Here all p(n,4)= A008284(n,4)  partitions of n with 4 parts are considered. The color repertoire for a bracelet with n beads is [c[1], ..., c[n]].",
