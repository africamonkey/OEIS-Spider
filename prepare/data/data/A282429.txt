        "3 is not a term. Proof: Suppose 3 is a term of A282026. For the corresponding n, 2*n + 1 cannot be divisible by 3 because of A282026\u2019s definition (gcd(3, 2*n + 1) = 1). So 2*n + 1 can be only of the form 6*k + 1 or 6*k + 5. But 6*k + 1 + 2*1 and 6*k + 5 + 2*2 are both composite numbers and 1, 2 are relatively prime to any odd number. Since they are smaller than 3, this is the contradiction to the assumption that 3 is the term which is the smallest number for corresponding n. This also proves that 3*k cannot be a term of this sequence for any k >= 1."
