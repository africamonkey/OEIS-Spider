        "The nonnegative integers with an odd number of even powers of 2 in their base-2 representation are given in A158705.",
        "It appears that a result similar to Prouhet's Theorem holds for the terms of A158704 and A158705, specifically: Sum[k^j, 0<=k<2^n-1, k has an even number of even powers of 2] = Sum[k^j, 0<=k<2^n-1, k has an odd number of even powers of 2], for 0<=j<=(n-1)/2. For a recent treatment of this theorem, see the reference."
