        "For primes p, q, r the sum p^4+q^4+r^4 can be prime only if at least one of p, q, r equals 3. This sequence is the special case q = r = 3.",
        "It is conjectured that the sequence is infinite.",

        "p = 5: 5^4+2*3^4 = 787 is prime, so 5 is in the sequence.",
        "p = 7: 7^4+2*3^4 = 2563 = 11*233, so 7 is not in the sequence.",
