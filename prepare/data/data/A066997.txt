        "Boyko Bantchev defines the survivor number for the second-order Josephus problem with n persons as follows: a(n) is not the number of the actual survivor but that of the person to be eliminated; that is, every second person in a circle is marked until only one remains - and that one is eliminated; having eliminated a(n), start again from the beginning with the remaining n-1 people, eliminate the one whose ordinal number in the new sequence is a(n-1), then do the same with the n-2 remaining and so forth, until only one is left. This is the survivor number."
