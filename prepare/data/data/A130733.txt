        "Added word: 'increasing'. The original puzzle was expressed as a modulo operation, the expression was 'remainder + quotient * divisor', where the remainder is necessarily smaller than the divisor, implying an increasing sequence. Counterexample if 'increasing' is not specified: a=8, b=4, c=2. a+b*c = 16 = 4^2; 4 is not in sequence A130733 - James Cunnane (james.cunnane(AT)gmail.com), Jun 29 2010",
