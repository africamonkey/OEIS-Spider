    "name": "Locations of the increasing peak values of the integral of the absolute value of the Riemann zeta function between successive zeros on the critical line. This can also be defined in terms of the Z function; if t and s are successive zeros of a renormalized Z function, z(x) = Z(2 Pi x/log(2)), then take the integral between t and s of |z(x)|. For each successively higher value of this integral, the corresponding term of the integer sequence is r = (t+s)/2 rounded to the nearest integer.",
    "comment": [
        "The fractional parts of the numbers r = (t+s)/2 above are very unevenly distributed. For all of the values in the table, the integers are in fact the unique integers contained in the interval of zeros [t, s] of z(x). An interesting challenge to anyone wishing to do computations related to the zeta function would be to find the first counterexample, where in fact the peak value interval did not contain the corresponding integer. Perhaps even more than the peak values of the zeta function themselves, these integrals are extremely closely related to relatively good equal divisions of the octave in music theory."
