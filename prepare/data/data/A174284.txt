    "comment": [
        "This sequence is a modification of A153588, which uses only series and parallel combinations. Since a bridge circuit requires minimum of five resistances the first four terms coincide. The fifth term also coincides, since set corresponding to five resistors for the bridge give {1}, is already obtained in the fourth set corresponding to the fourth term in A153588."

    "example": [
        "Five equal unit resistors, each arm of the bridge has one unit resistor, leading to an equivalent resistance of 1; so the set is {1} and its order is 1. Example-2: 6 equal resistors, four arms have one unit resistor each and the fifth arm has two unit resistors. Two resistors in the same arm, when combined in series and parallel result in 2 and 1/2 respectively (corresponding to 2: {1/2, 2} in A048211). The set {1/2, 2}, in the diagonal results in {1}. Set {1/2, 2} in any of the four arms results in {11/13, 13/11}. Consequently, with 6 equal resistors, we have the set {11/13, 1, 13/11}, whose order is 3."
