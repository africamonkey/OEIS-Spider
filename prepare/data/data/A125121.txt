        "Reply from _T. D. Noe_, Dec 20 2009: Although theorem 2.1 in the paper by Stolarsky is useful, the seqfan e-mail from Jack Brennen sometime around July 2008 is the key to computing these numbers. \"To determine if an odd number N is flimsy, take the finite set of residues of 2^a (mod N). Assume that the number of 1's in the binary representation of N is equal to C. To show that the number is flimsy, find a way to construct zero (mod N) by adding up some number of residues of 2^a (mod N) using less than C terms. To show that the number is sturdy, show that it's impossible to do so.\" In short, this sequence, though difficult to compute, is well defined.",
