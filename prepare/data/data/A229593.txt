        "The boomerang pattern is one of a total of 17 distinct patterns appearing in a 3 X 2 rectangular array of coins where each pattern consists of perimeter parts from each of 6 coins and forms a continuous area. See illustration of 6-curve patterns in links.",
        "a(n) is the number of boomerang patterns appearing in an n X n array of coins with rotation not allowed. The number of inverse patterns is given in A229598.",
        "It appears that a(n+1) is equivalent to n multiplied by the least possible number of addends in the partition in which the addends are multiplied together to produce the largest possible product for all n > 2. E.g., in the case of a(11), we look for partitions of 10, and for each partition we take the product of all its addends. The largest possible product formed is 3*3*2*2 = 3*3*4 = 36. The least possible number of addends here is 3, which we multiply by 10 to get 30. - _Laurance L. Y. Lau_, Jun 22 2015"
