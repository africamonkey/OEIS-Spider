        "Take a standard set of 28 dominoes (with 0 to 6 spots) and arrange them in a 1 X 56 rectangle so that an increasing sequence of integers can be read (inserting the necessary commas). Form the sum of all the said integers: this sum cannot be less than 888. This is one of the five sequences of integers corresponding to such an arrangement. See A108377, A108378, A108379, A108392 for the others."
