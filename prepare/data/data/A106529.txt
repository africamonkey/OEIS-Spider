    "comment": [
        "It seems like the ratio between successive terms tends to 1 as n increases meaning perhaps most numbers are in this sequence.",
        "Each term can be expressed as a product of k primes and the number of terms that all have the k-th prime as their factor is given by sequence A000984, which are the central binomial coefficients, starting 1,2,6,20,70. E.g. 6 and 9 are the two terms in A106529 with 3 as their highest factor.",
        "Sequence contains the positive integers n such that the rank of the partition B(n) = 0. For n>=2, B(n) is defined as the partition obtained by taking the prime decomposition of n and replacing each prime factor p by its index i (i.e. i-th prime = p); also B(1) = the empty partition. For example, B(350) = B(2*5^2*7) = [1,3,3,4]. B is a bijection between the positive  integers and the set of all partitions. The rank of a partition P is the largest part of P minus the number of parts of P. - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 09 2015"
