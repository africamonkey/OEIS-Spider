        "The smallest prime p such that p^4 divides the Numerator of BernoulliB[ a(n) ] are given in A122273[n] = {5,5,7,5,5,7,...}. Note that numerator of BernoulliB[6250] is divisible by 5^5. a(n) is a subset of A122270[n] = {250,686,750,1250,1372,1750,...} Numbers n such that numerator of Bernoulli number B(n) is divisible by a cube. a(n) is also a subset of A090997[n] = {50,98,150,196,228,242,250,...} Numbers n such that numerator of Bernoulli number B(n) is divisible by a square."
