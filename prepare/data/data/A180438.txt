        "By symmetry under reversal, a(n) also counts length n cubical billiard words acting as suffix to just k length n+1 cubical billiard words. Computation: _Fred Lunnon_ for 0 <= n <= 19 (MAGMA). The program in A180437 counts k-special words for k = 1, ..., m, where m = 3 denotes the size of the alphabet."
