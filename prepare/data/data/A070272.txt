        "For n>0 5*(6*10^A056716(n)-1) is in this sequence. In fact if p = 6*10^n-1 is prime and n>0 (p>5) then m = 5*p is in the sequence. That's because phi(m) = phi(5*p) = 4*(6*10^n-2) = 24*10^n-8 and sigma(m)= 6*6*10^n, so phi(m) + sigma(m) = 6*10^(n+1)-8 = 5.(9)(n).2 = reversal(2.(9)(n).5) = reversal (3*10^(n+1)-5) = reversal(m)(dot between numbers means concatenation and \"(9)(n)\" means number of 9's is n). For example 299999995 is in the sequence because 6*10^7-1 is prime and 299999995 = 5*(6*10^7-1); 299999999995 is in sequence because 6*10^10-1 is prime and 299999999995 = 5*(6*10^10-1).
