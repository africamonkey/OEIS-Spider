        "Without the condition on monotonicity, this would be essentially the same as A052187, but there 255767 is followed by 247099, while monotonicity here gives 689467. Similarly, following a(9) = A052187(10) = 6314393 we have a(10) = 9113263, while A052187(11) = 4911251. The next term which is not matching is a(14) = 69266033 vs A052187(15) = 34346203. One may notice that the two terms differ approximately by a factor of 2."
