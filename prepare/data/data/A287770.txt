        "Conjecture: 0 < n*r - a(n) < 1 for n >= 1, where r = (15 - sqrt(5))/10. It has been verified by computer that a(n) = floor(n*r) for n=1..3*10^6.",
        "This conjecture can be proved from the result in the Comments of A287769, where it is shown that A287769 is a Sturmian sequence with slope s := 1 - 1/(3+phi) = (15+sqrt(5))/22. The conjecture then follows from Lemma 9.1.3 in \"Automatic sequences\", since r = 1/s. - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 11 2017"
