        "The hexagonal lattice is the familiar 2-dimensional lattice in which each point has 6 neighbors. This is sometimes called the triangular lattice.",
        "The extra constraint here is that the next to \"middle\" points of the walk must be adjacent in the lattice.  Exact details are in the Redner paper. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Nov 20 2017"
