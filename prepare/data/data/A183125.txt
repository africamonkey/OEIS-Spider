        "A.   The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the presented sequence is NOT optimal. The particular \"61\" algorithm solving the puzzle at hand is not explicitly presented in any of the referenced papers. For the optimal solution of the Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the given pre-coloring configuration (the \"natural\" or \"free\" Magnetic Tower) see A183117 and A183118. Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.",
