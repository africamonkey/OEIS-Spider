        "The European Union uses eight coins - worth 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents, plus 1- and 2-Euro coins - with a range of values from 0 to 499. The average cost of making change in Europe, _Jeffrey Shallit_ calculates, is 4.6 coins. The best way to lower the cost, to 3.92, would be for Europeans to add yet another coin, worth either 1.33 or 1.37 Euros (the sequence as shown uses 133, though 137 is an equally valid solution)."
