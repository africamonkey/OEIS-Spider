        "Next term, if it exists, is > 10^125074. - _David Wasserman_, Aug 13 2004",
        "Since x+y is a factor of x^m+y^m if m is odd, 2^m+3^m is divisible by 2+3=5 unless m is zero or a power of 2. This is similar to Fermat numbers 1+2^m. - _Michael Somos_, Aug 27 2004",
        "Checked k being powers of two through 2^21. Thus a(5) > 10^2000000. Primes of this magnitude are rare (about 1 in 4.6 million), so chance of finding one is remote with today's computer algorithms and speeds. - Robert Price, Apr 25 2013",
        "If a(5) exists it is greater than 10^16000000. Probably complete. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 29 2013"
