        "This sequence arises as a result of exponentiation using the terms of the sequence A002808 as the base and the terms of the sequence A000040 as the exponent. This sequence has the very special and rare property of double exponential growth, meaning that its rate of growth grows. This property is due to the unregular growth of the prime exponent in the generating function for this sequence."
