        "Analog of A151723 and A151725, but here we are working on the hexagonal net where each triangular cell has three neighbors (meeting along its edges). A cell is turned ON if exactly one of its three neighbors is ON. An ON cell remains ON forever.",
        "We start with a single ON cell.",
        "There is a dual version where the triangular cells meet vertex-to-vertex. The counts are the same: the two versions are isomorphic. Reed (1974) uses the vertex-to-vertex version. See the two Sloane \"Illustration\" links below to compare the two versions.",
        "It appears that a(n) is also the number of polytoothpicks added in a toothpick structure formed by V-toothpicks but starting with a Y-toothpick: a(n) = a(n-1)+(A182632(n)-A182632(n-1))/2. (Checked up to n=39.) - _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 07 2010 and _R. J. Mathar_, Dec 17 2010",
        "It appears that the behavior is similar to A161206. - _Omar E. Pol_, Jan 15 2016",
        "It would be nice to have a formula or recurrence.",
