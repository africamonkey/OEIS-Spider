        "The members of L_n are paths of weight n that start at (0,0) and end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: a (1,0)-step with weight 1, a (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps."
