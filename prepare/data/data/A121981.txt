        "A bifix (sometimes biprefix) code is a set of nonempty words X such that no word of X is a proper prefix or a proper suffix of another. The degree of a finite maximal bifix code X is the maximal number of parses that a word can have with respect to X.",
        "It is known that there are finitely many finite maximal bifix codes of each degree."
