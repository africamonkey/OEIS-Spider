Roughly 3% of all primes less than 20 billion belong to this sequence or the 2n + 1 sequence. The interval between composite terms 12228632879 and 13169544651 contains 1113606 primes, accounting for 2.75% of the primes in the interval and 1.42% of the primes between 24457265759 and 26339089303.",

        "The ones digit of composite terms is most often 1, and becomes progressively more likely to be 1. It is never 5. It cannot be 7, because 2n + 1 would then be divisible by 5. The lack of solutions with n divisible by 5 appears crucial to the consistent primality of 2n + 1.",
