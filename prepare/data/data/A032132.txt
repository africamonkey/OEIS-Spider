        "Apparently, beginning with a(3), number of non-equivalent canonical forms of separation coordinates on the hyperspheres. Cf. Sch\u00f6bel and Veselov for this and other interpretations. - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 21 2017",
        "From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jan 17 2018: (Start)",
        "Let A(x) = Sum_{n>=1} a(n)*x^n. For a derivation of the formula BIK(A(x)) = (1/2)*(A(x)/(1-A(x)) + (A(x) + A(x^2))/(1-A(x^2))), see the comments for sequence A001224 and the weblink below containing Bower's theory of transforms.",
        "We clarify the comment by T. Copeland above. Consider the material in Section 3 of Devadoss and Read (2001). According to their terminology, let b(m,n) be \"the number of A-clusters having m cells and n outside edges not counting the root edge.\" Let B(x,y) = Sum_{m>=0, n>=0} b(m,n)*x^m*y^n. (See p. 78 in their paper, where they use the notations a_{m,n} and A(x,y) rather than b(m,n) and B(x,y), respectively, that we use here.)",
        "On p. 79 (Eq. (3.1)) of their paper, they prove that B(x,y) = y + (x/2)*(B(x,y)^2/(1-B(x,y)) + (1 + B(x,y))*B(x^2, y^2)/(1-B(x^2,y^2))). Unfortunately, the factor x in the previous formula is left out (i.e., it is a typo), and the same typo is reproduced in Sch\u00f6bel and Veselov (2014, 2015).",
        "Using Table 2 (p. 92) from Devadoss and Read (2001) (and the material on p. 79), we get that B(x,y) = y+ x*y^2 + (x^2 + x)*y^3 + (2*x^3 + 3*x^2 + x)*y^4 + (3*x^4 + 8*x^3 + 5*x^2 + x)*y^5 + ...",
        "We claim that a(n) = Sum_{m>=0} b(m,n) and A(y) = Sum_{n>=1} a(n)*y^n = B(x=1, y). To prove these claims, note that, for x=1, the above series becomes B(x=1,y) = y + y^2 + 2*y^3 + 6*y^4 + 17*y^5 + ..., while the functional equation above becomes B(1, y) = y + (1/2)*(B(1,y)^2/(1-B(1,y)) + (1 + B(1,y))*B(1,y^2)/(1-B(1,y^2))), which is equivalent to 2*B(1,y) = y + (1/2)*(B(1,y)/(1-B(1,y)) + (B(1,y) + B(1,y^2))/(1-B(1,y^2))). The latter formula is the one given in the formula section below (derived from Bower's theory) with x replaced with y and A(x) replaced with B(1,y). This proves that B(x=1, y) = A(y), from which we can easily get that a(n) = Sum_{m>=0} b(m,n).",
        "Note that b(m=0, n) = 0 for n <> 1, but b(m=0, n=1) = 1; b(m,n) = 0 when m >= n >= 1; and b(m=1, n) = 1 for n>=2. Also, b(m,m+1) = A001190(m+1) for m>=1, which are the Wedderburn-Etherington numbers, and apparently b(m=2, n) = A024206(n-1) for n>=2 (conjecture).",
        "In Section 6 of their paper, Sch\u00f6bel and Veselov (2014, 2015) prove that b(m,n) is the \"number of non-equivalent faces of [the Stasheff polytope] K_n of codimension m-1.\" Apparently then, for n>=2 and k>=0, b(n-k,n+1) is the \"number of canonical forms for separation coordinates of [hypersphere] S^n\" with k \"independent continuous parameters\". For k=0 and n>=2, b(n,n+1) = A001190(n+1) = \"number of canonical forms for separation coordinates\" of hypersphere S^n with 0 continuous parameters.",
        "It turns out that for k, the number of continuous parameters of S^n, we have 0 <= k <= n-1 (see pp. 1269-1270 in Shobel and Veselov (2015)). Hence, for n>=2, Sum_{k=0..n-1} b(n-k, n+1) = Sum_{m=1..n} b(m, n+1) = Sum_{m=0..n} b(m, n+1) = a(n+1) (see above). As a result, for n>=2, a(n+1) is the \"total number of [non-equivalent] canonical forms for separation coordinates on [hypersphere] S^n\", which is the comment made by T. Copeland above.",
