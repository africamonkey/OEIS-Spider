        "Of course there cannot be any number that is expressed in any of the usual ways without w, o, r, t or h, between eleven and a googol. \"Twelve and the -teens and -ties, factorials\" all contains at least one \"t\". Powers all contain \"-to-the-\". \"Score\" or \"dozen\" or \"gross\" contain at least an \"o\". \"Hundred\" and \"thousand\" contain at least an \"h\" and \"-illion\" contains an \"o\". Reading digit-by-digit would lead to the duller sequence: 5, 6, 7, 9, 55, 56, 57, 59 and exclude that very worthless number, five-elevens. - _Michael Joseph Halm_, May 05 2006"
