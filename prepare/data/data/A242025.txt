        "Related to the search for large primitive weird numbers: Kravitz has shown that 2^(k-1)*Q*R is a primitive weird number (cf. A002975 and subsequence A258882) when Q > 2^k and R = (2^k*Q-Q-1)/(Q+1-2^k) both are prime. Here we consider such primes for the special case of Mersenne primes Q = 2^p-1, p in A000043. For such Q one has R = 2^k-1+(2^k-2)/(2^(p-k)-1), which must be an integer and prime number.",
        "See A242998 for the number of exponents k leading to primes R, for given Q = A000668(n), p = A000043(n). But there is no one-to-one correspondence since the primes are here listed according to their size (cf. example)."
