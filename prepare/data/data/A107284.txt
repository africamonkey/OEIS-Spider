    "name": "a(n)/4^n is the measure of the subset of [0,1] remaining when all intervals of the form [b/2^m - 1/2^(2m), b/2^m + 1/2^(2m)] have been removed, with b and m positive integers, b<2^m and m<=n.",
    "comment": [
        "Removing all such intervals (without an upper limit on n) leaves a nowhere dense subset of [0,1]. It is of positive measure, namely 0.2677868402178891123766714035843..., the limit of a(n)/4^n. This is the same as the limit of A003000(n)/2^n and of A045690(n)/2^n and half the limit of A105284(n)/4^n."

The second step in addition removes the intervals [3/16,1/4) and (3/4,13/16], leaving a subset with measure of 3/8=6/16. The third step in addition removes the intervals [7/64,9/64] and [55/64,57/64], leaving a subset with measure of 5/16=20/64."
