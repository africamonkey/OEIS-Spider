        "Here a \"X-toothpick\" is defined to be a cross with 4 endpoints and a midpoint. Also, a X-toothpick can be represented by set of four connected toothpicks forming a cross.",

        "At stage 1 place a X-toothpick.",
        "Rule: each exposed endpoint of the X-toothpicks of the old generation must be touched by the midpoint of a X-toothpick of new generation (see illustrations).",
        "The sequence gives the number of X-toothpicks in the three-dimensional structure after n-th stage. A170171 (the first differences) gives the number of X-toothpicks added at n-th stage.",
