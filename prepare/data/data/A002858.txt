        "Ulam conjectured that this sequence has density 0. However, calculations up to 6.759*10^8 (_Jud McCranie_) indicate that the density hovers near 0.074.",
        "A plot of the first 3 million terms shows that they lie very close to the straight line 13.51*n, so even if we cannot prove it, we believe we now know how this sequence grows (see the plots in the links below). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 27 2006",
        "After a few initial terms, the sequence settles into a regular pattern of dense clumps separated by sparse gaps, with period 21.601584+. This pattern continues up to at least a(n) = 5*10^6. (This comment is just a qualitative statement about the wavelike distribution of Ulam numbers, not meant to imply that every period includes Ulam numbers.) - _David W. Wilson_",
        "_Don Knuth_ (Sep 26 2006) remarks that a(4952)=64420 and a(4953)=64682 (a gap of more than ten \"dense clumps\"); and there is a gap of 315 between a(18857) and a(18858).",
        "1,2,3,47 are the only values of x < 6.759*10^8 such that x and x+1 are both Ulam numbers. - _Jud McCranie_, Jun 08 2001.  This holds through the first 28 billion Ulam numbers - _Jud McCranie_, Jan 07 2016.",
        "From _Jud McCranie_ on _David W. Wilson_'s illustration, Jun 20 2008: (Start)",
        "The integers are shown from left to right, top to bottom, with a dot where there is an Ulam number. I think his plot is 216 wide. The local density of Ulam numbers goes in waves with a period of 21.6+, so his plot shows ten cycles.",
        "When they are arranged that way you can see the waves. The crests of the density waves don't always have Ulam numbers there but the troughs are practically void of Ulam numbers. I noticed that the ratio of that period (21.6+) to the frequency of Ulam numbers (1 in 13.52) is very close to 8/5. (End)",
