    "comment": [
        "It has been shown that if the outer Soddy circle center of a triangle lies on one of its sides then this side is the longest and is equal in length to both the outer Soddy radius and the excircle radius associated with the vertex opposite the longest side. Furthermore, the sum of the tangents of the triangle's half angles opposite the two smaller sides equals 1."
