    "name": "Based on the exceptional group sequence: a(n)=2*Gamma[n+3]+2^n where n=1+x/3 and the result is rounded to the nearest integer. A linearization of the dimensional results based on a least squares fit of the dimensions of the known exceptional groups. I use Round[] as giving a better result than Floor[]. This method is an approximation that relates to the idea of rational dimensions for sets.",
