        "Definition using terminology of [MM]: Asigma(k)' is the number of symmetric numerical sets S with Frobenius number 2k-1. This is denoted A^\\sigma_{2k-1}^\\prime in [MM]. Asigma(k)' equals the number of sigma-admissible subsets L of {1,2,...,2k-2} such that if x is an element of M then 2k-1-x is not an element of M. It also equals the number of vertices at height k in the rooted tree shown in figure 5 of [MM]. For large k, Asigma(k)' is approximately equal to .23065 x 2^(k-1) [MM]. The number of symmetric numerical sets with Frobenius number 2k and no small atoms equals Asigma(k)' by theorem 19 of [MM]."

This program calculates the cardinality of the number of symmetric numerical monoids without a small atom (or symmetric \"good sets\") for Frobenius number, $g$, as represented by $A_g^\\sigma'$ defined in \"Counting numerical sets with no small atoms\" ([MM]) by Jeremy L. Marzuola and Andy Miller (to appear in Journal of Combinatorial Theory: A). ! Here we set the parameters of computation. We represent a numerical set by binary representations of the elements below the Frobenius number.",
        "Namely, a $0$ means an element is not in a set and a $1$ means an element is in the set. The symmetric numerical sets will be stored in an array called $Gin$, which will be redefined for each $g$ for the purposes of iterating the algorithm. Each row of Gin corresponds to a numerical set, e.g. the row $Gin(3,-)=(1,1,0,1,0,0)$ would determine the numerical set ${1,2,4} \\cup N_5$. This is a slight variation of the notation presented in Figure 5 of [MM], where only the initial half segment is presented since the remainder is clear by symmetry.",
