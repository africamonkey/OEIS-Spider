        "A109104! is a subsequence of this sequence. Also this sequence is a subsequence of A001013 and is not equal to A001013. 14! is the earliest term of A001013 which is greater than 1 and is not in the present sequence. All numbers of the form 2^m*3^n where m is positive and n is not greater than m are in the sequence. If p is prime and p+1 is in the sequence then p+1 is a term of the sequence A109104."
