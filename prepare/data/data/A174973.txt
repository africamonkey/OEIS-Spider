        "That is, if the divisors of a number are listed in increasing order, the ratio of adjacent divisors is at most 2. The only odd number in this sequence is 1. Every term appears to be a practical number (A005153). The first practical number not here is 78.",
        "Let p1^e1*p2^e2...pr^er be the prime factorization of a number, with primes p1 < p2 <...< pr and ek > 0. Then the number is in this sequence if and only if pk <= 2*Product_{j < k} p_j^e_j. This condition is similar to, but more restrictive than, the condition for practical numbers.",
        "The polymath8 project led by Terry Tao refers to these numbers as \"2-densely divisible\". In general they say that n is y-densely divisible if its divisors increase by a factor of y or less, or equivalently, if for every R with 1 <= R <= n, there is a divisor in the interval [R/y,R]. They use this as a weakening of the condition that n be y-smooth. - _David S. Metzler_, Jul 02 2013",
