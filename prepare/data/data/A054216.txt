        "Obviously b(n) = 100^n - 10^n + 1 = (91,9901,999001,99990001,...) is a subsequence. Are { b(2), b(4), b(6), b(8) } the only terms of this sequence that are prime? - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 30 2008. Answer: The smallest prime in this sequence that is not of the form b(n) is A054216(155) = 811451682377384625400019885321 [_Max Alekseyev_, Oct 08 2008].
