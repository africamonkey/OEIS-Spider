        "A partition of 0 is a set {i(1), i(2),..., i(n)} of nonzero integers with sum 0.  Such a set uniquely partitions into two multisets {x(1),..., x(j)} and {y(1),..., y(k)} where x(1)+x(2)+...+x(j) =-[y(1)+y(2)+...+y(k)] and x(i) > 0 and y(i) < 0 for every i.  The number x(1)+x(2)+...+x(j) is the positive part-sum.",
        "Let p(h) be the number of partitions of h>=1, as in A000041.  There are p(h)^2 ways to choose each of the sets {x(1),...,x(j)} and {y(1),...,y(k)} having sum h.  Consequently, there are p(1)^2+p(2)^2+...+p(n)^2 partitions of 0 having positive part-sum <= n."
