        "A generalized Wieferich sequence is an increasing sequence of primes p[1],p[2],... such that a=p[n+1] is a Wieferich prime to base b=p[n], i.e., a^(b-1)=1 (mod b^2).",
        "The present sequence is a subsequence of A179400. The numbers 728437, 1051139, 144 449603 and 5176 948723 found by M. Kamada and D. Broadhurst are also in this sequence. The last two numbers are even 7th elements of a generalized Wieferich sequence, cf. the link."

        "It happens that after a(2)=6211, there are four subsequent elements of A179400, namely 13477, 19069, 20431 and 22567, which are also member of a sequence of length 5 and thus in this sequence."
