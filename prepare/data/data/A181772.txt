        "Given on p.8 of Dixon, with \"coincidence\" involving Fibonacci numbers.",
        "Since there is no indication of how the sequence 1,2,8,24 might be extended, I have marked this as \"fini\" and \"full\". - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 12 2010",
        "Let x = {1, 2, 8, 24}. Then (Lambda_x/x + 1)^2 - 1 = {8, 15, 960, 67092480} and is either a cake number (A000125) or the product of consecutive cake numbers. For instance, 960 = 1 * 2 * 4 * 8 * 15 = (Lambda_8/8 + 1)^2 - 1 and 67092480 = 1 * 2 * 4 * 8 * 15 * 26 * 42 * 64 = (Lambda_24/24 + 1)^2 - 1. This is interesting, at least in part, since x^2 = {1, 4, 64, 576} is also a cake number. - Raphie Frank, Dec 06 2012"
