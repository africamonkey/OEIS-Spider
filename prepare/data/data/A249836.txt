        "Supersequence of A079332, hence 3083975227 and 214112296674652 are members. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Nov 07 2014",
        "This sequence consists of all positive-valued terms of A088306. (Of the first 1000 terms in A088306, 518 are positive.) - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Nov 07 2014",
        "From _Daniel Forgues_, May 27 2015, Jun 12 2005: (Start)",
        "Numbers n for which tanc(n) > 1, where tanc(n) = tan(n)/n, tanc(0) = 1, where n are radians; cf. Weisstein link.",
        "It is an open problem whether tan(n) > n for infinitely many integer n.",

        "For n <= tan(n) < n+1, or floor(tan(n)) = n, we get a fixed point of the iterated floor(tan(n)). Currently, the only known fixed points are 0 and 1. (Cf. A258024.)",
        "It is proved that |tan n| > n for infinitely many n, and that tan n > n/4 for infinitely many n. (Bellamy, Lagarias, Lazebnik) (End)",
        "Since tan(n) has a transcendental period, namely Pi, it seems very likely that not only tan(n) > n for infinitely many integers n, but also that tan(n) > kn for infinitely many integers n, for any integer k. It even seems likely that not only n < tan(n) < n+1 for infinitely many integers n (not just for n = 1), but also that kn < tan(n) < kn + 1 for infinitely many integers n, for any integer k. It seems that we are bound to stumble upon the requisite positive delta s.t. n mod Pi = Pi/2 - delta. - _Daniel Forgues_, Jun 15 2015",
        "It appears that we need {n / Pi} = 0.5 - delta, with delta < k/n, for some k, where {.} denotes the fractional part: we have, 260515/Pi = 82924.49999917..., 37362253/Pi = 11892774.4999999915... etc. - _Daniel Forgues_, Jun 18 2015, edited by _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 19 2015",
        "Indeed, from the graph of the function we see that tan(n) > n for numbers of the form n = (m + 1/2)*Pi - epsilon (i.e., n/Pi = m + 1/2 - epsilon/Pi) with small epsilon > 0, for which tan(n) = tan((m + 1/2)*Pi - epsilon) = tan(Pi/2-epsilon) ~ 1/epsilon, using tan(Pi/2-x) = sin(Pi/2-x)/cos(Pi/2-x) = cos(x)/sin(x) ~ 1/x as x -> 0. Thus tan(n) > n if epsilon < 1/n, or delta = epsilon/Pi < k/n with k = 1/Pi. - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 19 2015"
