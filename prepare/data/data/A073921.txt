        "No further term below 21000000. Sequence is probably finite because the preferential placement of primes at earlier places than nonprimes in A073920 leads to 2 clearly separated branches in the plot of A073920 as a result of the prime number theorem. This leaves a void in between, in which the current sequence fails to find more points. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 13 2008"
