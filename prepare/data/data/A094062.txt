        "From a new version of the camel problem. The original camel problem is discussed by de Bondt. A camel can carry one banana at a time on his back. It is on diet and therefore can only have one banana at a time in its stomach. As soon as it has eaten a banana it walks a mile and then needs a new banana (in order to be able to continue its itinerary).",
        "Let there be a stock of N bananas at the border of the desert. How far can the camel penetrate into the desert? (Of course it can form new stocks with transported bananas.)",
        "The new version: Find a(n), the number of bananas needed for the camel to penetrate into the desert at least n miles."
