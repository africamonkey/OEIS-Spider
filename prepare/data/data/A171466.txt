    "comment": [
        "A transit is a kind of eclipse, in which a planet is seen to \"transit\" across the sun. The transiting planet appears as a small black dot slowly making its way across the sun's area.",
        "Transits are predictable events, but certain characteristics of the orbit of Mercury in relation to the orbit of Earth complicate the pattern. For those years in which a Mercury transit occurs, it occurs in either May or November. Each transit is separated by 3.5, 7, 9.5, 10 or 13 years. Barring any significant changes to the orbits of the planets in the solar system, the predicted transits should occur as expected."
