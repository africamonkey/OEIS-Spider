        "This also appears to be true for the Fibonacci sequence (A000045) and the sequence of powers of 2 (A000079): it takes two additional iterations of these sequences for the number of digits of these iterated sequences to grow faster than the corresponding original sequences. However, it appears that it takes only one additional iteration of the factorial (A000142) for this to happen.",
