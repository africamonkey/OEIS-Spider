        "We define an \"L-toothpick\" to consist of two line segments forming an \"L\".",
        "There are two size for L-toothpicks: Small and large. Each component of small L-toothpick has length 1. Each component of large L- toothpick has length sqrt(2).",
        "The rule for the n-th stage:",
        "If n is odd then we add the large L-toothpicks to the structure, otherwise we add the small L-toothpicks to the structure.",
        "Note that, on the infinite square grid, every large L-toothpick is placed with angle = 45 degrees and every small L-toothpick is placed with angle = 90 degrees.",
        "The special rule: L-toothpicks are not added if this would lead to overlap with another L-toothpick branch in the same generation.",
        "We start at stage 0 with no L-toothpicks.",
        "At stage 1 we place a large L-toothpick in the horizontal direction, as a \"V\", anywhere in the plane (Note that there are two exposed endpoints).",
        "At stage 2 we place two small L-toothpicks.",
        "At stage 3 we place four large L-toothpicks.",
        "At stage 4 we place six small L-toothpicks.",
        "And so on...",
        "The sequence gives the number of L-toothpick after n stages. A172311 (the first differences) gives the number of L-toothpicks added at the n-th stage.",
        "For more information see A139250, the toothpick sequence.",
        "In calculating the extension, the \"special rule\" was strengthened to prohibit intersections as well as overlappings. [From _John W. Layman_, Feb 04 2010]",
        "Note that the endpoints of the L-toothpicks of the new generation can touch the L-toothp\u00eccks of old generations but the crosses and overlaps are prohibited. - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 26 2016"
