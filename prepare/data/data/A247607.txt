        "In the interval (2^4,2^5) [17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31], the prime 17 symmetrically couples with 31 around the midpoint of the interval, 23 around the midpoint of the halved interval, and 19 in the quartered interval. There is no composite couple. It has 3 prime and 0 composite symmetric connections. The same process for 19 produces 2 prime and 1 composite connection. Therefore 17 and 19 are members. 23 couples with 25, 17 and 22. It has 1 prime and 2 composite connections so it is not a member."
