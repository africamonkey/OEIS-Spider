        "The smallest cube prime factor of the numerator of BernoulliB[(a(n)] is given in A122271[n] = {5,7,5,5,7,5,5,11,7,5,5,7,5,5,13,5,7,5,...}. a(n) is a subset of A090997[n] = {50,98,150,196,228,242,250,284,294,338,350,392,450,484,490,550,578,650,676,686,...} Numbers n such that numerator of Bernoulli number B(n) is divisible by a square. A subset of a(n) is A122272[n] = {1250,3750,4802,6250,8750,9604,...} Numbers n such that numerator of Bernoulli number B(n) is divisible by Prime[k]^4. Conjecture : For all regular primes p>3 and integers k>0 the numerator of Bernoulli number B(2p^k) is divisible by p^k. In fact, for all regular primes p>3 and integers k>0, n = 2p^k is the smallest index such that numerator of Bernoulli number B(n) is divisible by p^k. Also, for all regular primes p>3 and integers k>0, all n such that numerator of Bernoulli number B(n) is divisible by p^k are of the form n = 2m*p^k, where m>0 is an integer."
