        "An HSI-algebra is a structure (1, +, *, ^) over some set such that Tarski's high-school identities hold: addition and multiplication are commutative and associative, multiplication distributes over addition, 1 is the multiplicative identity, x^1 = x, 1^x = 1, x^y * x^z = x^(y+z), (xy)^z = x^z * y^z, and (x^y)^z = x^(y*z).",
