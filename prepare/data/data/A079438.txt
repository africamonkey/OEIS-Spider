        "The original definition was: Number of rooted general plane trees which are symmetric and will stay symmetric after the underlying plane binary tree has been reflected, i.e., number of integers i in range [A014137(n-1)..A014138(n-1)] such that A057164(i) = i and A057164(A057163(i)) = A057163(i).",

        "However, _David Callan_'s A123050 claims to give more correct version of that count from n=26 onward, so I probably made a little mistake when converting my insights into the formula given here. At that time I reckoned that if the conjecture given in A080070 were true, then it would imply that the formula given here were exact, otherwise it would give only a lower bound.",
        "It would be nice to know what an empirical program would give as the count of fixed points of A071661 for n in range [A014137(25)..A014138(26)] = [6619846420553 .. 24987199492704], with total A000108(26) = 18367353072151 points to check.",
