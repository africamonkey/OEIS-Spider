        "Conjecture is true. Proof.",
        "1) Let C={c_1..c_n} be a permutation of {1..n}, d(C) be alternating sum c_1 - c_2 + ... +(-1)^(n-1)*c_n. Then max_{C in S_n}d(C) = A008794(n+1). Indeed, if n = 2*m, then evidently the maximum is reached on a C={2*m,1,2*m-1,2,...,m+1,m}; if n=2*m - 1, then the maximum is reached on a C={2*m-1,1,2*m-2,2,...,m-1,m}. In both cases max_{C in S_n}d(C) = m^2 = A008794(n+1). The number of distinct reaches of the maximum is, evidently, floor(n/2)!*floor((n+1)/2)! which is also Avi Peretz's representation (2001) of A010551(n). So, A293857(n) >= A010551(n) and a(n)>=1.",
        "2) Consider two cases: a) there are no C in S_n for which d(C) = k^2 < A008794(n+1). Then A293857(n) = A010551(n) and a(n) = 1; b) there is C for which d(C) = k^2 < A008794(n+1). Then, as in 1) to reach k^2 in case n=2*m consider all (n/2)! permutations of {c_1,c_3,...,c_n} and all (n/2)! permutations of {c_2, c_4, ... , c_(n+1)), or in case n = 2*m-1, all ((n+1)/2)! permutations of {c_1,c_3,...,c_(2*m-1)} and ((n-1)/2)! permutations of {c_2,c_4,...,c_(2m-2)}. So we again have A010551(n) distinct reaches. If the same k^2 could be reached by another permutation C_1 (other than above permutations of C), then we again obtain A010551 distinct reaches, etc. So, A293857(n) is always divisible by A010551(n).
