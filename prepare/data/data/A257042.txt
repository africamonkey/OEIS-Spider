        "The smallest integer that satisfies this is 120: it has 15 proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60) and 5 prime factors (2, 2, 2, 3, 5), so d(120)=10. The square of 120, 14400, we would expect to have a difference of 52 between the number of its proper divisors and prime factors, and with respectively 62 and 10, d(120)=52 indeed. Checking this with further integer powers of 120 will continue to generate terms in this sequence.",
