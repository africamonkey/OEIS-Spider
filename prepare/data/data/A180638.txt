        "From the abstract: \"We prove that the maximal number N_c of non-relativistic electrons that a nucleus of charge Z can bind is less than 1.22Z + 3.1Z^(1/3).",
        "This improves Lieb's (1984) upper bound N_c < 2Z+1 when Z <= 6. Our method also applies to non-relativistic atoms in magnetic field and to pseudo-relativistic atoms. We show that in these cases, under appropriate conditions, limsup_{Z->infty} N_c/Z <= 1.22.\"",
        "Note that the published version of the paper, as revisions v2 and v3 on the arXiv, use the stronger bound 1.22Z + 3Z^(1/3) instead, where the constant 1.22 can be improved to 1.21684.... In particular this improves the bound for lithium, aluminium, scandium, chromium, cobalt, zinc, arsenic, krypton, yttrium, zirconium, etc. Asymptotically Seco, Sigal, & Solovej show that the maximum ionization is n + O(n^(5/7)) and it is conjectured that the maximum ionization is n + O(1). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 13 2016"
