        "A rotation of the decimal digits to the left puts the leading digit in the rightmost position (123456 becomes 234561). The (even) integers that are cut in half by this operation form 10 families; a singleton {a(0)=0} and 9 infinite families, each consisting of any number of repetitions of an 18-digit pattern.",
