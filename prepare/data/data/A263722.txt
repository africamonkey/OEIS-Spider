        "Conjecture: All terms are odd. An equivalent conjecture in A263977 is that if k > 0 is even, then k^2 + p^2 is prime for some prime p. We have checked this for all k <= 12*10^7.",
        "An odd number k is a term if and only if k^2 + 2^2 is composite, since k^2 + p^2 is even and > 2 (hence composite) for all odd primes p. Thus if the Conjecture is true, then the sequence is simply odd k such that k^2 + 4 is composite. The sequence of odd k, such that k^2 + 4 is prime, is A007591.",
        "The complementary sequence is A263977. Given k in it, the smallest prime p, such that k^2 + p^2 is prime, is in A263726. These numbers k^2 + p^2 form A185086, the Fouvry-Iwaniec primes."
