        "Found by exhaustive search. Program produces all values that are combinations of two binary operators a() and b() (here \"sum\" and \"reciprocal sum of reciprocals\") over n occurrences of 1. E.g., given 4 occurrences of 1, the code forms all allowable postfix forms, such as 1 1 1 1 a a a and 1 1 b 1 1 a b, etc. Each resulting form is then evaluated according to the definitions for a and b.",
        "Each resistance that can be constructed from n 1-ohm resistors in a circuit can be written as the ratio of two positive integers, neither of which exceeds the (n+1)st Fibonacci number. E.g., for n=4, the 9 resistances that can be constructed can be written as 1/4, 2/5, 3/5, 3/4, 1/1, 4/3, 5/3, 5/2, 4/1 using no numerator or denominator larger than Fib(n+1) = Fib(5) = 5. If a resistance x can be constructed from n 1-ohm resistors, then a resistance 1/x can also be constructed from n 1-ohm resistors. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Aug 06 2006",
