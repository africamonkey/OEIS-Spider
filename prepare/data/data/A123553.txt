    "name": "A \"king chicken\" in a tournament graph (a directed labeled graph on n nodes with a single arc between every pair of nodes) is a player A who for any other player B either beats B directly or beats someone who beats B. Sequence gives total number of king chickens in all 2^(n(n-1)/2) tournaments.",
    "comment": [
        "H. G. Landau showed in 1951 that there may be several king chickens in a tournament and that a player is a king chicken if he has the highest score. The converse is not true and there can be more king chickens than highest scorers. The smallest example has 4 players: A beats B and C, B beats C and D, C beats D, D beats A; D is a king chicken despite having fewer points than A and B. Maurer showed in 1980 that there is one king chicken if one player beats all others and otherwise there are at least three."
