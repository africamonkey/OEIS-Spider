        "Numbers n such that n divides the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers are listed in A111035(n) = {1, 2, 24, 48, 72, 77, 96, 120, 144, 192, 216, 240, 288, 319, 323, 336, 360, ...}. Most terms in A111035(n) are the multiples of 24. a(n) coincides with A072378(n) up to 84. The first two different terms are 86 and 164. Prime a(n) are {2, 3, 5, 281, ...}. Numbers n such that n divides the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers and such that n is not a multiple of 24 are listed in A124456(n) = {1,2,77,319,323,1517,3021,4757,6479,7221,8159,8229,9797,...}."
