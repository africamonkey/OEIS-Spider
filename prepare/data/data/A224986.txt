        "Consider words on n symbols that contain every permutation of those n symbols as contiguous substrings. The minimal length of such a string is conjectured to equal A007489(n) (see A180632). This sequence is a lower bound on the number of distinct (up to relabeling the symbols) such strings of the conjectured minimal length.",
        "It was conjectured in the Ashlock paper that, for all n, there is only one string containing all permutations of length A007489(n). This sequence shows that this conjecture fails as n grows."
