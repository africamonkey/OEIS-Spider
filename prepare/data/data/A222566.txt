        "For a prime p define g(p) as the least prime q>p such that 2*(p+1)-q is prime. Construct a simple (undirected) graph G as follows: The vertex set of G is the set of all primes, and for the vertices p and q>p there is an edge connecting p and q if and only if g(p)=q. Clearly G contains no cycle.",
        "Conjecture: The graph G constructed above is connected and hence it is a tree!"
