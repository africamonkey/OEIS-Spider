        "Represents the numbers of ordered compositions of n using the terms of A224342: (1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 18, 32,...); such that the latter represents the numbers of ordered compositions of n using the terms of A224341.",
        "It appears that given any sequence of real terms pulled out of a hat S(n); repeated iterates of S(n) -> characteristic function of S(n) -> INVERT transform of the latter -> next sequence, (repeat); will converge upon two alternating sequences A224341 and A224342 as a fixed limit, as to absolute values."
