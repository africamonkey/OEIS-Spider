        "Obviously, there is only one solution for a, b and c to the equation p X p X p = a X b X c where p is prime, if a > 1, b > 1 and c > 1. So there can be only one rectangular prism that is composed of p^3 unit cubes, if a > 1, b > 1 and c > 1. That rectangular prism is the p X p X p cube. Its uniqueness is a motivation for this sequence.",
