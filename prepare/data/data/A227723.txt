    "comment": [
        "Two Boolean functions belong to the same big equivalence class (bec) when they can be expressed by each other by negating and permuting arguments. E.g., when f(~p,r,q) = g(p,q,r), then f and g belong to the same bec. Geometrically this means that the functions correspond to hypercubes with binarily colored vertices that are equivalent up to rotation and reflection.",
        "Boolean functions correspond to integers, so each bec can be denoted by the smallest integer corresponding to one of its functions. There are A000616(n) big equivalence classes of n-ary Boolean functions. Ordered by size they form the finite sequence A_n. It is the beginning of A_(n+1), which leads to this infinite sequence A."
