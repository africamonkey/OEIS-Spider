    "comment": [
        "The starting number n is regarded as part of the trajectory, so palindromes are excluded from the sequence. A088753 is obtained if palindromes are not excluded. The smallest term in A063048 but not in A088753 is 19098, the smallest term in A088753 but not in A063048 is 9999.",
        "Subsequence of A023108. Sequence A070788 is similarly defined, but palindromes are irrelevant. Corresponding sequences for other bases are A075252 (base 2), A077405 (base 3), A075421 (base 4).",
        "If the trajectory of a number k joins the trajectory of a smaller number which is a term of the present sequence, then this occurs after very few Reverse and Add! steps (at most 8 for k < 100000, at most 10 for k < 1000000). On the other hand, the trajectories of the terms < 14000 do not join the trajectory of any smaller term within at least 1500 steps. This is the precise meaning of \"presumably\" in the definition.",
        "The terms are rather unevenly distributed. They form clusters, especially above 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, ... . The interval from 10000 to 11000 for example contains 26 terms, whereas only two terms occur in the interval from 90000 to 100000."

The trajectory of 1997 joins the trajectory of 106 at 97768 (cf. A070796), but 106 is not a term of the present sequence."
