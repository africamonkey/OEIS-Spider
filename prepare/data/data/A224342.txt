        "It appears that given any sequence of real numbers taken out of a hat, S(n); repeated iterates of the operation: S(n) -> characteristic function of S(n) -> INVERT transform of the latter -> new sequence, then (repeat), will converge upon two sequences A = A224341 and B = A224342 as a 2-cycle fixed limit.",
        "Alternatively as a conjecture, A and B solve the unique identity as described in the heading as to ordered compositions; with A = A224341 and B = A224342. The INVERT transform of the characteristic function of A = B; and the INVERT transform of the characteristic function of B = A."
