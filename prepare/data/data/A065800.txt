        "I can show that for r > 1, the first r-digit term of the sequence is the smallest r-digit primorial, if it exists. It remains to investigate the first terms when existence fails. It is also not hard to see that for r > 1, the r-digit terms are in arithmetic progression with common difference equal to the smallest r-digit term. For example, 210, 420, 630, 840 are in arithmetic progression with common difference 210. Obviously the r-digit minimizer of n/phi(n) is the largest prime of n digits."
