        "Suppose that p is a partition of n.  Let m X m be the size of its Ferrers matrix, f(p), defined at A237981.  Then f(p) consists of ceiling(m/2) concentric squares, where the innermost square is a single point if m is odd.  The square partition of p is introduced here as the partition [x(1), x(2) ,..., x(k)], where x(i) is the number of 1s in the i-th concentric square, where the squares are taken in order starting with the outermost."
