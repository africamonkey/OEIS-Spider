        "Given a polyomino P on a square lattice, if you replace each of the squares in P with a point (say the \"upper-left\" corner) and call that set of points S, then define H to be the convex hull of S: the polyomino is said to be a \"convex-hull polyomino\" if all lattice points in H are also in S."
