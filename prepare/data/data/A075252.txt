        "Base-2 analog of A063048 (base 10) and A075421 (base 4); subsequence of A066059. - For the trajectory of 22 (cf. A061561) and the trajectory of 77 (cf. A075253) it has been proved that they do not contain a palindrome. A similar proof can be given for most terms of this sequence, but there are a few terms (4262, 17498, 33378, 33898, ...) whose trajectory does not show the kind of regularity that can be utilized for the construction of a proof. - If the trajectory of an integer k joins the trajectory of a smaller integer which is a term of the present sequence, then this occurs after very few 'Reverse and Add!' steps (at most 84 for numbers < 20000). On the other hand, the trajectories of the terms of this sequence do not join the trajectory of any smaller term within at least 1000 steps."
