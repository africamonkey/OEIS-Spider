        "Starting with sequence 1 and adding increasing numbers coprime to sum of previous elements yields periodic sequence A001651.",
        "By starting with 1,2,3, you get this sequence, apparently non-periodic with sporadic periodic runs of varied length.",
        "Sequence appears to have density of about 0.6 with respect to the positive integers.",
        "Not all primes are in this sequence, 19 being the first missing prime."
