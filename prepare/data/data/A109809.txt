    "comment": [
        "The Levenshtein distance (also called edit distance) between two strings is equal to the minimum number of insertion, deletion, or substitution operations needed to transform one string into the other. It is named after the Russian scientist Vladimir Levenshtein, who developed this metric in 1965. Levenshtein distance is a generalization of Hamming distance. For positive n, the string length of a(n+1) is always the 1 + the string length of a(n). This sequence is infinite."
