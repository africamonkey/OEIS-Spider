        "Let the random variable X be the coefficient of t^2 in the characteristic polynomial det(tI-A) of a random matrix in USp(6) (6x6 complex matrices that are unitary and symplectic). Then a(n) = E[X^n].",
        "Let L_p(T) be the L-polynomial (numerator of the zeta function) of a genus 3 curve C. Under a generalized Sato-Tate conjecture, for almost all C, a(n) is the n-th moment of the coefficient of t^2 in L_p(t/sqrt(p)), as p varies.",
