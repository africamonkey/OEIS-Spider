    "comment": [
        "\"God's Number\" is the maximum number of turns required to solve any scrambled cube. The \"Half turn metric\" considers a 90- or 180-degree turn of any side to be a single turn. The number is not known for cubes of size larger than 3 X 3 X 3.",
        "God's number has been proved using a brute-force attack for the 2 X 2 X 2 and 3 X 3 X 3 cubes. For the 4 X 4 X 4 cube, it has been proved only that the lower bound is 31, while the most probable value is considered to be 32; solving this by brute force would require checking all the A075152(4) possible permutations of the \"Master Cube\". - _Marco Rip\u00e0_, Aug 05 2015"
