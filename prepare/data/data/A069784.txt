        "Proof:",
        "Let e_n(n, p) be the exponent of p in n!. The prime p has exponent e_(n, p) = n/p for sqrt(n) < p < n in n!. n/4 <= p < n/3, e_(n, p) = 3 so e_(n, p) * 3 = 9. and for n/5 <= p < n/4, e = 4. The gap g_n between prime(n) and prime(n+1) is about sqrt(n) * log(n). There is a gap of n/4 - n/5 = n/20 between n/5 and n/4. primepi(1000) = 168, so for n > 5*1000, the gap between n/5 and the next prime is about sqrt(168) * log(168) ~= 66. This is much less than n/20. No 40 <= m <= 15000 is in the sequence, which completes the proof. (End)"
