        "63 has the prime-factorization 3^2 * 7^1. 64 has the prime-factorization 2^6. And 65 has the prime-factorization 5^1 * 13^1. The exponent, 6, in the prime-factorization of 64 differs from the exponents, 2 and 1, in the prime-factorization of 63 and differs from the exponents, 1 and 1, in the prime-factorization of 65. So 64 is in the sequence.",
        "On the other hand, the prime-factorization of 39 is 3^1 * 13^1. The prime-factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5^1. 1 occurs as both an exponent in the prime-factorization of 39 and in the prime-factorization of 40. So neither 39 nor 40 is in the sequence."
