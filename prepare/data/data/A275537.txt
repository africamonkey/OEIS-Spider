    "comment": [
        "For every n a cardinality of S has to be found such that the number of all possible nonempty proper subsets of S is greater than the number of all possible sums of the elements of those subsets. When it becomes so, the Pigeonhole Principle guarantees there are two disjoint subsets of S with the same sum of elements."
