        "From _Emeric Deutsch_, Jan 28 2018: (Start) Also the indices of the compositions that have a prime number of parts. For the definition of the index of a composition see _A298644_. For example, 27 is in the sequence since its binary form is 11011 and the composition [2,1,2] has 3 parts. On the other hand,58 is not in the sequence since its binary form is 111010 and the composition [3,1,1,1] has 4 parts. The command c(n) from the Maple program yields the composition having index n.
