        "It is easy to check that with x = 6n^2, y = 6n^3 - 1, and this z = 6n^3 + 1, it satisfies the Diophantine equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3 - 2. Thus these are near-misses for Fermat equation.",
        "For n>2, it seems to be the only solution of x^n + y^n = z^n - 2 (or even that differ by 2 from FLT, see A050787 and A050791 for solutions that differ by 1). As 2 is not a cube, these solutions are not included in the theory for x^3 + y^3 = u^3 + v^3."
