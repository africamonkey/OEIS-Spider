    "comment": [
        "The primitive values of x^2 + x*y + y^2 where x >= y >= 0 and GCD(x, y) = 1 are given by A034017. However there are incidents in the sequence A034017 where different values of (x, y) yield the same primitive value. Furthermore, the number of solutions for a given primitive value equates to a power of 2. See A121940."
