        "The Goldbach conjecture being true would imply that for every integer j, there exists at least one integer k such that (j^2)-(k^2) is an odd semiprime; i.e., for 2j=p+q, j=(p+q)/2 and k=(p-q)/2 results in (j^2)-(k^2)=pq. [Note that in many cases, 2j can be expressed as the sum of more than one set of two primes.] See A205728 for related series where p must be distinct from q."
