    "comment": [
        "A geometrical configuration of type (n_3) consists of a set of n points in the Euclidean or extended Euclidean plane together with a set of n lines, such that each point belongs to 3 lines and each line contains 3 points.",
        "Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum comments that it would be nice to settle the question as to whether all combinatorial configurations (13_3) are (as he hopes) geometrically realizable."
