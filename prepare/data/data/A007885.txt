        "A nondecreasing sequence a_1, ..., a_n is called balanced if the n-1 quantities D(a_1,...,a_k)+D(a_(k+1),...,a_n) (1<=k<=n-1) are all equal, where D(a_1,...,a_k) is the sum of the absolute deviations of the a's from their median. Up to affine equivalence, there's a unique balanced sequence of any given length.",
