        "It remains to prove that for certain n, pq+n != y^3 for all consecutive primes p and q. This list was computed for p and q with prime indices up to 100000. Also note that this is not a complete list but rather the first occurrence of a solution. For example, n = 101 has 2 solutions p=29,q=31 for 29*31+101=1000 = 10^3 and p=197,p=199 for 197*199+101 = 38304 = 34^3. n square tend to have more solutions."
