    "comment": [
        "Here, a star graph is a tree on n nodes (n>=4) with one specially designated (center) vertex, v of degree n-1.  We are allowed to add edges so that the degree of any node (excepting v) is at most 3 and so that every cycle includes the vertex v with the possible exception of a single cycle of length n-1 through each non-center vertex. We note that any time edges are added the original \"center\" node remains specially designated.  a(n) is the number of such connected simple labeled graphs with a specially designated node.",
        "If we don't add any edges we have a star graph and there are n labelings.",
        "If we add exactly one edge then we produce a cycle of length 3 and we no longer have a tree.",
        "If we add the maximum number of edges we get a wheel graph A171005."

        "a(4) = 32. There are 4 labelings for the star graph on 4 nodes. There are 12 labelings after we add one edge. There are 12 labelings after we add two edges. There are 4 labelings after we add 3 edges. 4+12+12+4=32."
