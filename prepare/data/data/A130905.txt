        "a(n) is also the number of oriented simple graphs on n labeled vertices, such that each weakly connected component with 3 or more vertices is a directed cycle. - _Austin Shapiro_, Apr 17 2009",

        "a(n) is the number of permutations of an n-set where each transposition (two cycle) is counted twice. That is, each transposition is an involution and is its own inverse, but if we imagine each transposition can be oriented in one of two ways, then a permutation with oriented transpositions is just a oriented simple graph. Conversely, an oriented simple graph with restrictions on connected components comes from a permutation with oriented transpositions. - _Michael Somos_, Jul 25 2011"
