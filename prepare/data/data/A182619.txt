        "This sequence can be constructed geometrically in the following manner: Construct a gapless array of n equal circles with the rule of always choosing an arrangement with the maximum number of completely enclosed inner circles. Then, a(n) equals the number of circles required to create a kissing perimeter around the original array. Examples: a(1) = 6 because it takes 6 circles to create a kissing perimeter around 1 circle. a(7) = 12 because it takes 12 circles to create a kissing perimeter around 7 circles, which are arranged with 1 circle in center surrounded by 6 kissing circles. One could describe this as the \"kissing numbers of kissing circles\" sequence. - _Peter Woodward_, Apr 25 2015",
