        "Consider a strong Goldbach conjecture: every even number n>=6 is a sum of two primes the least from which is O((log(n))^2log(log(n))) (cf. comment to A152522). The number of such representations for 2^k, trivially, is less than k^5 for k>k_0. Removing the maximal primes in every of such representations of 2^k, k>=3, we obtain an analog B of A152451 with the counting function H(x)= pi(x)-O((log(x))^5). Replacing in B the first N terms by N consecutive primes (with arbitrary large N), we obtain a sequence which essentially is indistinguishable from the sequence of all primes with help of the approximation of pi(x) by li(x), since, according to well known Littlewood result, the remainder term in the theorem of primes could not be less than sqrt(x)logloglog(x)/log(x). But for this sequence we have infinitely many even numbers for which the considered strong Goldbach conjecture is wrong. Thus the conjecture is essentially unprovable."
