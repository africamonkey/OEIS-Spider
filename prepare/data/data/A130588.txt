        "T. D. Noe found no more values up to 10000 and agrees with my conjecture that this sequence is probably finite. This is related to Chen's Theorem: \"Every 'large' even number may be written as 2n = p + m where p is a prime and m in A001358 is the set of semiprimes (i.e., 2-almost primes)\" which itself is related to Goldbach's conjecture. However, we have no proof, merely the sense that it gets easier and easier to find more and more A014612(i) + A000040(j) = n decompositions as n increases."
