        "Take an integer like 36, for example. Concatenate an infinite number of copies of itself: 363636363636363636363636... Put your left index on the first digit (3), jump 3 digits (to the right) with your right index and erase the digit you're landing on (3). Move your left finger (to the right) on the next visible digit (6). Jump thus 6 digits (to the right) with your right finger and erase the digit you're landing on, etc. If the number you started with (36) appears suddenly between two erased digits, you have a \"Self-erasure surviving number\".",
