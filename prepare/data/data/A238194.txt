        "The first case (130) yields a number divisible by 83^2. The next 5 terms yield numbers divisible by 59^2. Boyd et al. are not completely certain about the other 994 numbers up to 1000. They conjecture that 0.9934466... of numbers n^n + (-1)^n (n-1)^(n-1) are squarefree.",
        "Boyd et al. tested the values n <= 1000 for divisibility by the squares of the \ufb01rst 10^4 primes. To extend the sequence, I tested the divisibility of n <= 200000 by the squares of the first 10^5 primes. - _Giovanni Resta_, Feb 24 2014",
        "The heuristic chance that Resta's list is incomplete is just over 1%. This drops to 0.07% with testing to the millionth prime. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 25 2014"
