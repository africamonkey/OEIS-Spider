    "comment": [
        "The sequence S(n,-2,1,1), n>=0, is A016269. It would be interesting to study the more general sequences S(r,-m,1,1), r=0,1,2,... for fixed m; here we consider the special cases m=3 and m=2. Finally, one can use the sum S(r,k,t,q) to discover certain recurrence relations involving poly-Bernoulli numbers. Let us note that the well known recurrence of the classical Bernoulli numbers yields S(r,1,1,1)=r+1. Let us also note that numerical experimentation suggests that S(r,-2,1,1)=S(r,-3,0,q)."
