        "Bifactorial (n B m) is the number of ways of drawing the single marked item in choice m out of n choices with n-1 alternating draws of unmarked items, both without replacement, out of 2n-1 total items. Probability P(m|n) of drawing the marked item in choice m of n total choices is P(m|n) = (n B m) / (n+1 B 1).",
        "Generalized Monte Hall (GMH) problem: There are 2n-1 doors, behind each door there is either a car or one of 2n-2 goats. Player picks a door (Choice 1), game master reveals another door with a goat. Player can either stay with Choice 1 or continue to play. In which case he chooses one of the 2n-3 remaining doors (Choice 2). Game master then reveals another door with a goat and the player can either stay with Choice 2 or continue to play the same way till the last door (Choice n). Number of ways to pick a car in Choice m out of n total choices is (n B m).",
        "The name \"bifactorial\" comes from triangular matrix of rank n, with even factorials in the lower half and odd ones in the upper, whose products by m-th rows gives n B m. Such matrix describes the sample space of outcomes in GMH for each choice i given car in choice m.",
