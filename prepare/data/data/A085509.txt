        "To extend to base 2 only numbers of the form 2^n-1 need to be considered, since all others have zero digits in base 2.",

        "But no such triple can exist, since, given three consecutive numbers, one must be divisible by 3, which implies that it ends in a zero in base 3. - _Robert G. Wilson v_"
