    "comment": [
        "For n=1 the length of the line to cover is equal to 2. There is only one way to cover it with 2-length segment and it will be the full cover. So, the probability is equal to 1. For n=2 the length of the line to cover is equal to 4. Lets start randomly and sequentially to cover it with 2-length segments. The first segment could be placed at 3 position with probability 1/3 in the following ways (xxoo, oxxo, ooxx). The second 2-length segment could be added only in the first and the last cases. So we have the following covers (xxxx, oxxo, xxxx). Thus the probability to find the full cover of 4-length line when it is randomly sequentially filled by 2-length segments is equal to 2/3."
