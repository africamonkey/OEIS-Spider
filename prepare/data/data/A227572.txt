        "This sequence is based on the original height of 175 cm of the Modular-man. For the sequence based on the later chosen height of 183 cm see A228779.",
        "Note that Le Corbusier used other numbers in the figure found on p. 51 of the given reference. For example, he uses 7, 9, 25, 66 instead of 6, 10, 26, 67. The height of the navel is at 108 cm. This sequence is an alternative to Le Corbusier's so called red series.",
        "Le Corbusier used (in the earlier version) the height of the navel as precisely 108 cm. Compare with the later version with navel height 113 cm, with numbers given on p. 84 of the Modulor reference. The height is then actually A = phi*108 cm (golden section phi), approximately 174.75 cm, as seen from the construction on p. 50 of the reference, and rounded to 175 cm. The so called red series would be round(phi^(-13 + n)*108) = 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, 25, 41, 67, 108, 175, 283, ..., n>=0. On p. 51 the number 66 should be replaced by 67, as given on p. 50. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 05 2013"
