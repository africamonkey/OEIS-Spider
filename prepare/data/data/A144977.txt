        "a(n) is the number of hyperforests with n unlabeled nodes without trees of order 2. This follows from the fact that for n>=2 A134955(n-2) counts the hyperforests of order n with one or more trees of order 2.",
        "The unique hyperforest (without loops) of order 1 is an isolated vertex, so a(1) = 1.",
        "For n>=2, a(n) - a(n-1) counts hyperforests of order n with components of order >=3."

    "example": [
        "a(3) = 3 since the only options are 2 hypertrees of order 3, or the forest composed by 3 isolated nodes."
