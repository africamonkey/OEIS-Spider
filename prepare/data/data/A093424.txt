    "comment": [
        "Original definition: Number of different two-dimensional burst patterns in the grid graph: The grid graph has Z^2 as vertices and each vertex (x,y) is connected to (x-1,y),(x+1,y),(x,y-1),(x,y+1). A cluster of size t is a set of t points such that each pair of points of the set is on a connected path contained entirely within the set. A burst pattern is a labeling of Z^2 with 0's and 1's. The term a(n) denotes the number of different (up to a translation) burst patterns whose 1's are covered by a cluster of size n.",
        "As show the examples 3,5,6 and 7, the set needs not be connected itself, but this is always the case when it has n points, it then coincides with the covering set. - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 28 2014"
