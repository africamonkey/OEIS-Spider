        "Supersequence of A134970. The structure of digits represent a canyon (a deep valley between cliffs). The first digits are in decreasing order. The last digits are in increasing order. There is only one  smaller digit which represents the bottom of the canyon. But the restriction that both cliffs are at same level (first digit equal to the final digit) is dropped here.",
        "This sequence is finite. The largest term is 9876543210123456789.",
        "Question: How many terms are there in this sequence?"
