    "comment": [
        "According to a general theorem of Golomb (1966) on subtraction games, this sequence is infinite, and more strongly (because of known results on the density of A005153) the number of terms below any given n is at least logarithmic in n."

    "example": [
        "For instance, 10 is a P-position because each of the available moves (subtracting 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 to yield 9, 8, 6, 4, or 2) can be countered: from 8, 6, 4, or 2, it is possible to win by moving directly to 0 and from 9 it is possible to win by subtracting 6 and moving to the smaller P-position 3."
