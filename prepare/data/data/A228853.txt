        "As a tree, infinitely many branches are essentially linearly recurrent sequences.  The extreme cases, (1,2) -> (2,3) -> (3,5) -> ... and (1,2) -> (2,5) -> (5,12) -> ..., contribute A000045 (Fibonacci numbers) and A000129 (Pell numbers) to A228853.",
        "Suppose that (u,v) and (v,w) are consecutive edges.  The continued fraction of w/v is obtained from the continued fraction of v/u by prefixing 1 if w = v + u, or 2 if w = 2v + u.  Consequently, if each edge is labeled with 1 or 2 in the obvious way, then the continued fraction of w/v is the sequence of 1s and 2s, in reverse order, from the node 2 to the node w, with 2 attached at the end.  (See Example, Part 2).",
        "Is A228853 essentially A141832?  (If so, the answer to the question in Comments at A141832 is that A141832 is infinite.)"
