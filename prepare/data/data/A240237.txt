The result is a(n).",

        "Through the so-called \"pyramidalization\" process a given nonnegative integer is decomposed into its digits, which are \"reassembled\" afterwards by concatenating each level of the pyramid (separately, from left to right) and subsequently concatenating these results, from the base to the top.",
