        "Consider twin primes p, q = p + 2 such that pq + 2 is prime. It would seem that there are infinitely many such p. Except for p = 3 and p = 5 all such p appear to be of the form 30k - 1 and the values of k give the current sequence. - _James R. Buddenhagen_, Jan 09 2007",
        "This is true. Prime numbers (other than 2,3,5) are 30k + 1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29. p+2 is then prime only for p = 30k + 11,17,29; then p(p+2)+2 is 30k + 25,25,1 respectively, so the last case mod 30 is the only one possible. - Gareth McCaughan (gareth.mccaughan(AT)pobox.com), Jan 09 2007",
        "This is the sequence of positive integers k such that p = 30*k - 1, q = 30*k + 1 and p*q + 2 are all prime. - _James R. Buddenhagen_, Jan 09 2007"
