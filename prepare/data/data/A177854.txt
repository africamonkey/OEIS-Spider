        "The Brillhart-Lehmer-Selfridge algorithm provides a general method for proving the primality of P as long as one can factor P+1 or P-1. Therefore for any prime number, when P+1 or P-1 is completely factored, the primality of any factors of P+1 or P-1 can also be proved by the same algorithm. The shortest recursive primality proving chain depth is called the rank of P (cf. A169818)."
