        "These are values in A055558 whose rotation by 180 degrees occurs in A092571. I have checked all the numbers that correspond to entries in A002957 and can confirm that the next term in this sequence, if it exists, is greater than 2*10^55347-1. [From _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, May 22 2009]"

        "1999, for instance, is a prime which rotated upside down through 180 degrees becomes the prime 6661. Hence 1999 is in the sequence."
