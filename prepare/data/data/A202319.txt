        "Conjecture: For every natural number k there are infinitely many semiprime pairs sp and sp' both sandwiched between semiprimes such that sp' - sp = 4k.",
        "Note: For the case k=1 the pair of two consecutive semiprime triples will be called twin semiprime-triple with an analogy to twin prime.",
        "The number centered between the triples of a twin semiprime-triple must be divisible by 36. Let n be the middle of such a twin semiprime-triple. It is trivial that n is divisible by 4, and that it is congruent to 0, 4, or 5 (mod 9). If it was congruent to 4, then n-1 and n+2 would both be divisible by 3, hence equal to 3 times a prime. But then those two primes would differ by 1, impossible except for primes 2, 3, which can be checked separately. A similar argument eliminates the case n == 5 (mod 9), so n must be divisible by 9.
