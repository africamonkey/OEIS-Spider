        "A082134 is the analogous sequence if \"union\" is replaced by \"intersection\" and A002697 is the analogous sequence if \"union\" is replaced by \"symmetric difference\". Here, X union Y = Y union X are considered as the same Cartesian product [Relation (37): U_Q(n) in document of Ross La Haye in reference], if we want to consider that X Union Y and Y Union X are two distinct Cartesian products, see A212698.
