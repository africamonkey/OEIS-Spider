        "Let G be the group (Z/2Z)^n * S_n. (Here * denotes the semidirect product. Each member of G is a function f from {-n, -n+1, ..., -2, -1, 1, 2, ..., n-1, n} to itself such that f is bijective and f(-x) = -f(x). The operation is composition.) Let C be a Coxeter element of G such that C(i) = i+1 for i = 1, 2, ..., n-1 and C(n) = -1. Let s_ij, i eq j and i,j > 0, be the function such that s_ij(i) = j, s_ij(j) = i and s_ij(k) = k for all k eq i,j, k > 0. Let s_2 be the function such that s_2(2) = -2 and s_2(k) = k for all k eq 2. Then a(n) is the number of ways to write C as a product of the s_ij's and s_2, using as few elements as possible.",
