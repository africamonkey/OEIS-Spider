        "The underlying sequence is also called invertible primes or strobogrammatic primes. The subsequence of prime partial sum of primes that yield a different prime when rotated by 180 degrees begins: 19, 10321, 17401, 25411, 181693. The subsubsequence of primes that yield a different prime when rotated by 180 degrees which are partial sum of primes that yield a different prime when rotated by 180 degrees begins: 19, and I don't know the next. The smallest values which become a different number (though not a prime) when inverted are: 989, 11990. The subsequence of squares in the sequence begins: 13689 = 3^4 * 13^2."
