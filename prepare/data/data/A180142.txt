        "The a(n) represent the number of n-move routes of a fairy chess piece starting in a given side square (m = 2, 4, 6 or 8) on a 3 X 3 chessboard. This fairy chess piece behaves like a rook on the eight side and corner squares but on the central square the rook goes berserk and turns into a berserker, see A180140.",
