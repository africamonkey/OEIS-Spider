        "All terms are congruent to 5 mod 36.",
        "For sequences of this type, once you get a(n) == 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, or 35 mod 36, all later terms stay in the same congruence class mod 36. Sequences in the same congruence class are likely to merge after a few terms. Thus with a(1) = 77 you get 77, 113, 149, 293, 617 and from then on it's the same as the present sequence. - _Robert Israel_, Sep 05 2014"
