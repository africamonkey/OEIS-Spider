        "The generating rule is expansion in sequential order on each stage; the smaller squares (opposite to the 30 deg angle) come first. The generating order labeled by \"stage-number\" starts as 1-1; 2-1, 2-2; 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4;...and so on. Overlap is prohibited, i.e., if any part of a new element in the next generating order cuts into any previous (existing, lower order) one, that new elements will be not be inserted/added: lower generating orders have precedence over higher generating orders.",
