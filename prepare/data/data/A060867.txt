        "Number of distinct lines through the origin in the n-dimensional lattice of side length 3. A001047 gives lines in the n-dimensional lattice of side length 2, A049691 gives lines in the 2-dimensional lattice of side length n. - _Joshua Zucker_, Nov 19 2003",
        "a(n) is also the number of n-tuples with each entry chosen from the subsets of {1,2} such that the intersection of all n entries is empty. See example. This may be shown by exhibiting a bijection to a set whose cardinality is obviously (2^n-1)^2, namely the set of all pairs with each entry chosen from the 2^n-1 proper subsets of {1,..,n}, i.e., for both entries {1,..,n} is forbidden. The bijection is given by (X_1,..,X_n) |-> (Y_1,Y_2) where for each j in {1,2} and each i in {1,..,n}, i is in Y_j if and only if j is in X_i. For example, a(2)=9, because the nine pairs of subsets of {1,2} with empty intersection are: ({},{}), ({},{1}), ({},{2}), ({},{1,2}), ({1},{}), ({2},{}), ({1,2},{}), ({1},{2}), ({2},{1}). - Peter C.

        "a(n) is the difference x-y where positive integer x has binary form of n leading ones followed by n zeros and nonnegative integer y has binary form of n leading zeros followed by n ones. For example, a(4) = (1111000-00001111)(base 2) = 240-15 = 225 = 15^2. The result follows readily by noting y=2^n-1 and x=2^(2*n)-1-y. Therefore x-y=2^(2*n)-2^(n+1)+1=(2^n-1)^2. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Sep 19 2016",
