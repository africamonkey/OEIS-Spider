        "The number of unit cubes on the surface of an n X n X n cube is given by sequence A005897.",
        "With a pair of scales, one might incorrectly think a single cube could be equal to the sum of two cubes. However, we know this is impossible because of Fermat's Last Theorem.",
        "But we can put a 6 X 6 X 6 cube containing only surface unit cubes on one scale: there are 152 unit cubes. In other side of the scale we can put a 3 X 3 X 3 cube and a 5 X 5 X 5 cube, so there are 27 unit cubes and 125 unit cubes, and the two pans balance."
