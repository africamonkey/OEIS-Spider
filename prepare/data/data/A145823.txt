        "These numbers are of the form 3n+1. This follows from the fact that a lower twin prime > 3 is of the form 3n+2. If p1 = 3n+1 then the upper twin would be 3n+1+2 = 3k which is not prime for k > 1. 4 is the only square which is a lower twin prime + 1. If a lower twin prime p1 + 1 is a square, then it is of the form 3n+2+1 or 3n. Then 3n = x^2 implies x = 3r for some r. This implies 3n = 9r^2. Now if we subtract 1 we have 9r^2-1 = (3r-1)(3r+1) which is not prime."
