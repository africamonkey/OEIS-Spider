        "Given that prime p has only one coach, the corresponding value of k in A003558 must be (p-1)/2, and vice versa.  Using the Coach theorem of Jean Pedersen et al., phi(b) = 2 * c * k, with b odd.  Let b = p, prime.  Then phi(p) = (p-1), and k must be (p-1)/2 iff c = 1. Or, phi(p) = (p-1) = 2 * 1 * (p-1)/2.",
        "Conjecture relating to odd integers: iff an integer is in the set A216371 and is either of the form 4q - 1 or 4q + 1, (q>0); then the top row of its coach (Cf. A003558) is composed of a permutation of the first q odd integers. Examples: 11 is of the form 4q - 1, q = 3; with the top row of its coach [1, 5, 3]. 13 is of the form 4q + 1, q = 3; so has a coach of [1, 3, 5]. 37 is of the form 4q + 1, q = 9; so has a coach with the top row composed of a permutation of the first 9 odd integers: [1, 9, 7, 15, 11, 13, 3, 17, 5]. - _Gary W.
