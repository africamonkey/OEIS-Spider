        "This sequence is finite, since the number of primes < n is ~ n/log(n), but liminf phi(n) / ( n*log(log(n)) ) = exp(-gamma), a consequence of Mertens's theorem (see Hardy and Wright's Theory of Numbers). Also, if there exists a further element, it is >700000 (as verified with the enclosed Mathematica code). (Question: is it possible to show that there are no further such elements by using explicit bounds in the Prime Number Theorem and in Mertens's theorem?) - Reiner Martin (reinermartin(AT)hotmail.com), Jan 16 2002",
