        "Related to the position and frequency of runs of length 2 in the Kolakoski sequence A000002. Possible values of the difference A156257 - A074292 are -1, 0, 1, and a 1 seems to be always followed soon by a -1, indicating that the two sequences A074292 and A156257 are not equal but rather close."
