        "Sequence contains no primes (A000040) and no semiprimes (A001358). - Zak Seidov, Apr 07 2011",
        "Sequences A025294 and A025313 are different. For example 1250 is not in A025313. A025294(9) = 1250 = 35^2 + 5^2 = 31^2 + 17^2 = 25^2 + 25^2 (not distinct squares). - _Vaclav Kotesovec_, Feb 27 2016",
        "Numbers in A025294 but not in A025313 are exactly those numbers of the form 2*p_1^(2*a_1)*p_2^(2*a_2)*...*p_m^(2*a_m)*q^4 where p_i are primes of the form 4k+3 and q is a prime of the form 4k+1.  Thus 2*5^4 = 1250 is the smallest term in A025294 that is not in A025313. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Feb 27 2016"
