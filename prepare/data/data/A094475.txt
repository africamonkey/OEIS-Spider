        "2^n+p^n is prime if n=0;or n=1 and p is a smaller of twin primes; or n=2 and 4+p^2 is prime; or n=3 and 8+p^3 is prime etc. Several conditions have to be satisfied to get a modest number of terms...",
        "n must be zero or a power of two.  Checked n being powers of two through 2^22. Thus a(5) > 10^5800000. Primes of this magnitude are rare (about 1 in 13.4 million), so chance of finding one is remote with today's computer algorithms and speeds. - _Robert Price_, May 02 2013"
