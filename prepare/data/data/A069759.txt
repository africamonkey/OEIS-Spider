        "The Frobenius number of a numerical semigroup generated by relatively prime integers a_1,...,a_n is the largest positive integer that is not a nonnegative linear combination of a_1,...,a_n. Since consecutive hex numbers are relatively prime, they generate a numerical semigroup with a Frobenius number. The Frobenius number of a 2-generated semigroup <a,b> has the formula ab-a-b."
