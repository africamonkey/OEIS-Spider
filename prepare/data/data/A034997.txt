        "a(d) is the number of parts into which d-dimensional space (x_1,...,x_d) is split by a set of (2^d - 1) hyperplanes c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + ...+ c_d x_d =0 where c_j are 0 or +1 and we exclude the case with all c=0.",
        "Also, a(d) is the number of independent real-time Green functions of Quantum Field Theory produced when analytically continuing from Euclidean time/energy (d+1 = number of energy/time variables). These are also known as Generalized Retarded Functions.",
        "The numbers up to d=6 were first produced by T. S. Evans using a Pascal program, strictly as upper bounds only. M. van Eijck wrote a C program using a direct enumeration of hyperplanes which confirmed these and produced the value for d=7. Kamiya et al. showed how to find these numbers and some associated polynomials using more sophisticated methods, giving results up to d=7. T. S. Evans added the last number on Aug 01 2011 using an updated version of van Eijck's program, which took 7 days on a standard desktop computer."
