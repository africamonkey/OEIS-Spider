    "comment": [
        "The primes from A002144 (1 (mod 4) primes) have the property A002144(n) = A002972(n)^2 + (2*A002973(n))^2 = A(n)^2 + B(n)^2 with odd A(n) and even B(n). A bisection of A002144 is given depending on A(n) + B(n) == 1 (mod 4) (part I) or A(n) + B(n) == 3 (mod 4) (part II). The present sequence gives part I of this bisection. The other part II is given in A279393.",
        "This bisection appears in the formula for the p-defects of the congruence y^2 == x^3 + 4*x (mod p) for primes p == 1 (mod 4). See A278720 where for nonvanishing entries the sign is conjectured to be + for these part I primes, and it is - for the part II primes from A279393."

        "a(1) = 13 is the first prime from A002144 which has A + B = 1 (mod 4) because 13 = A002144(2) = A(2)^2 + B(2)^2 = 3^2 + (2*1)^2, and 3 + 2 = 5 == 1 (mod 4), and A002144(1) = 5 leads to  A + B = 3 (mod 4), because 5  = 1^2 + (2*1)^2."
