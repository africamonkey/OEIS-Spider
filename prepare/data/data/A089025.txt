        "The cevians are numbers divisible only by primes of form 6n+1:A002476 (i.e., correspond to entries of A004611).",
        "Composite cevians c belong to more than one equilateral triangle, actually to 2^(omega(c)-1) of them, where omega(n)=A001221(n). For instance, cevian 1813=7^2*37, with omega(1813)=2, belongs to 2^(2-1)=2 equilateral triangles, their sides being 1927=255+1627 and 1960=343+1617, while cevian 1729=7*13*19, with omega(1729)=3, belongs to 2^(3-1)=4 equilateral triangles whose sides are 1775=96+1679, 1824=209+1615, 1840=249+1591, 1859=299+1560.",
        "Given a triangle with integer side lengths a, b, c relatively prime with a < b, c < b, and angle opposite c of 60 degrees then a*a - a*b + b*b = c*c from law of cosines and called a primitive Eisenstein triple by Gordon. This sequence is the possible side lengths of b. - _Michael Somos_, Apr 11 2012"
