        "Within the subset A045572 of numbers ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9, i.e., excluding numbers having 2 or 5 as prime factor, we look for two consecutive elements (x,y) which are both semiprimes and whose prime factors are \"adjacent\" primes, i.e., if x=p(i)*p(j), then we require y=p(i +/- 1)*p(j +/- 1)."
