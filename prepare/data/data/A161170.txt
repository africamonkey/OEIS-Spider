        "Related to sequence A125149, but we compare the prime count to the semiprime count, then the trieneprime count, and so on.",
        "We start with a the number two, and a prime count of 1.",
        "Then the prime count and semiprime count are first identical when k = 10, the prime count is 4 {2,3,5,7} and the semiprime count is also 4 {4,6,9,10}.",
        "Next, when k = 125 the prime count of 30 and trieneprime count of 30 are first identical.",
        "Based on the write up for A125149 and examination of the factor counts as k increases, we believe our sequence is infinite, but have not proved this."
