    "comment": [
        "This might be called the \"maximum diversity\" menage problem. Arrangements that differ only by rotation or reflection are excluded by the following conditions: Seat number 1 is assigned to person A. Seat number 2 can only be taken by a person of the same gender as A. The second condition forces an mmffmmff... pattern."

        "a(2)=6 because only the following arrangements are possible with 4 couples: ABdaCDbc, ABcaDCbd, ACdaBDcb, ACbaDBcd, ADcaBCdb, ADbaCBdc. This corresponds to the (2*2-1)! possibilities for persons B, C and D to choose a seat. After the positions of A, B, C and D are fixed, only A000183(2*2)=1 possibility remains to arrange their spouses a, b, c  and d."
