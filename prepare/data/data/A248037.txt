Since each tripling step increases the value by a factor greater than 3, and each halving step decreases it by a factor of exactly 2, we have n * 3^T / 2^H < 1, from which T/H < log(2)/log(3) - log_3(n)/H, so the ratio T/H cannot exceed log(2)/log(3) = 0.6309297535...",

Taking as values of n the terms from the b-file for A006877, and generating their trajectories to obtain the corresponding values of H(n), it does not seem clear whether log_3(n)/H(n) is converging toward zero or toward some positive limit, perhaps around 0.020 (which would mean T/H < log(2)/log(3) - 0.020, i.e., T/H < 0.611).",
