    "comment": [
        "Members of a sociable quadruple are usually listed in the order with which they appear in the corresponding aliquot sequence. Therefore, in a sociable quadruple the 1st member is abundant, and the 4th member is deficient. In all, we can get 4 possibilities, and a sociable quadruple can be (with A for abundant, and D for deficient) : AADD, ADDD, ADAD, AAAD. The numbers in these sequences have been voluntarily limited to 12 digits maximum, the current status of the exhaustive search (see Pedersen link)."
