    "comment": [
        "For initial values n > 3, the map is applied at least once, so 9 is in the sequence although it is not a prime. The sequence consists of p = 2 and p = 3 and the two finite chains of primes that are formed by repeated application of p -> 2*p + 3, which are 2 -> 7 -> 17 -> 37 -> 77 and 3 -> 9."
