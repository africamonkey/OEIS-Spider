    "comment": [
        "Consider an alphabet with two letters, say {0,1}. For two words v and w over this alphabet, we say v embeds in w, or v is a subsequence of w, if v can be obtained from w by erasing some (occurrences of) letters.",
        "For a natural number n, define two words to be n-equivalent if they have the same subsequences of length up to n. The n-th term of this sequence is the number of equivalence classes of this equivalence relation."
