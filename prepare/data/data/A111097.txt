    "comment": [
        "The numbers in my sequence match the first 8 nonzero numbers in sequence A083704 and the first 40 terms (at least) remain very close to those in A083704 . The program below is very crude and will yield the first 20 terms. To get further terms, one must increase the maximum value of n and then increase the maximum value of k so that the maximum value of k is larger than a(n) for the maximum value of n."
