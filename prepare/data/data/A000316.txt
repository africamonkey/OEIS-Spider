They take turns drawing names and give their gift to the person whose name they drew. If anyone draws either their own name or the name of their partner, everyone puts the name they have drawn back into the hat and everyone draws anew. a(n) is the number of different permissible drawings. - _Dan Dima_, Dec 17 2006",
