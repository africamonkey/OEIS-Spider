        "Erd\u0151s showed in 1956 how to construct Carmichael numbers from a given number n (see A287840). With appropriate sign changes the method can be used to generate Lucas-Carmichael numbers. Given a number n, let P be the set of primes p such that (p+1)|n but p is not a factor of n. Let c be a product of a subset of P with at least 3 elements. If c == -1 (mod n) then c is a Lucas-Carmichael number.",
