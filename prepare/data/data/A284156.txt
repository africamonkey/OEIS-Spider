        "Let sigma(n) denote the sum of divisors of n, and s(n) := sigma(n) - n, with the convention that s(0)=0. Untouchable numbers are those numbers that do not lie in the image of s(n), and they were studied extensively (see the references). In 2016, Pollack and Pomerance conjectured that the set of untouchable numbers has a natural asymptotic density.",
        "Let sk(n) denote the k-th iterate of s(n). 4-untouchable numbers are the numbers that lie in the image of s3(n), but not in the image of s4(n). Question: does the set of 4-untouchable numbers have a natural asymptotic density?"
