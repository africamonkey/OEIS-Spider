        "1, 5, 14, 30, 55, 91, 140, 204, 285, 385, 506, 650, 819, 1015, 1240, 1496, ...",
        "which has formula q(n) = n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/6.",
        "The term A280053(x) can be computed by repeatedly subtracting the largest q(n)<=x from x until 0 is reached. For example, 8 = 5+1+1+1, so A280053(8)=4",
        "Note that A280054 is strictly increasing. Let r be the last term so far in A280054, and s the next term. We must find the smallest term in q such that s-q(n-1) = r, or s=q(n-1)+r.  Therefore s will have one more phase than r, and it will be the smallest possible s.",
        "We also require that s<q(n), otherwise we must pick a larger n.  In other words, r must be less than the interval between q(n-1) and q(n), that is r < q(n-1)-q(n) = n^2",
        "Calculate n=floor(sqrt(r))+1 and from this we get s=q(n-1)+r.",
