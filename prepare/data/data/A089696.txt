        "Though the first 14 terms match with that of A089395, the next term of A089395 306 is not a member of this sequence. Conjecture: Sequence is finite.",
        "No more terms < 10^7. The first 13 terms match with that of A089395, but A089395(14) = 106 is not included because 1*0*6+1 = 1 is not prime. - _David Wasserman_, Oct 04 2005"
