    "comment": [
        "By Wilson's theorem, p! == 1 (mod p+2) whenever p,p+2 are twin primes. This sequence and A286208 concern consecutive primes p,q satisfying p! = 1 (mod q), where d = q-p > 2.",

        "Listed terms correspond to d = 12, 30, 76 (cf. A286230). Further terms should have d>=140.",
        "Also, primes p=prime(n) such that A275111(n)=1, and (prime(n),prime(n+1)) are not twin primes (i.e., p is not a term of A001359)."
