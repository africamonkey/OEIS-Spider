        "Sequence gives the number of edge-to-edge regular-polygon tilings having n topologically distinct vertex types. Allows tilings with two or more vertex types having the same arrangement of surrounding polygons, as long as those vertices are topologically distinct.",
        "There are eleven 1-uniform tilings (also called the \"Archimedean\" tessellations) which comprise the three regular tessellations (all triangles, squares, or hexagons) plus the eight semiregular tessellations."
