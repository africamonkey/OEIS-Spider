        "_Dean Hickerson_ (Oct 12 2001) writes: I suspect that there are no more terms in the sequence. In fact, I'll make the stronger conjecture that for all n>1260, n can be written as p + q*a^2 where a is the smallest prime that does not divide n. For example, for n=10080, a=11 and we have the representation 10080 = 7297 + 23 * 11^2.",

        "18 is in the sequence because p + 2*2^2 would imply that p is 10, or p + 2*3^2 would imply that p is 0, or p+ 3*2^2 would imply that p is 6, all of which are composite numbers."
