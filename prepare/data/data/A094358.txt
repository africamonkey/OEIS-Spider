        "It is clear from the observations by _Max Alekseyev_ in A023394 and the Chinese remainder theorem that any squarefree product b of divisors of Fermat numbers satisfies 2^(2^b) == 1 (mod b), hence satisfies Munafo's congruence above. The converse is true iff all Fermat numbers are squarefree. However, if nonsquarefree Fermat numbers exist, the criterion that is equivalent with Munafo's property would be \"numbers b such that each prime power that divides b also divides some Fermat number\". - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Mar 05 2014",
        "Also numbers b such that b is (squarefree and) a divisor of A051179(m) for some m. Or odd (squarefree) b where the multiplicative order of 2 mod b is a power of two. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Mar 07 2014"
