        "Number n is in the sequence, if and only if pi(n) = 2*pi(n/2), where pi(x) is the number of primes<=x. Indeed, all primes from interval (n/2, n] appear in prime power factorization of n! with exponent 1, while all primes from interval (0, n/2] appear  in n! with exponents >1. However, it follows from Ehrhart's link that, for n>=22, pi(n) < 2*pi(n/2). Therefore, a(9)=21 is the last term of the sequence.",
