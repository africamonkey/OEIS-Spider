        "If 10^n-3 is prime (n is in the sequence A089765) and m=3*(10^n-3) then m is in this sequence, for example 299999999999999991 is a term of this sequence because 299999999999999991=3*(10^17-3) and 17 is in the sequence A089675. So 3*(10^A089675-3) is a subsequence of this sequence, A101700 is this subsequence. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Dec 26 2004",
