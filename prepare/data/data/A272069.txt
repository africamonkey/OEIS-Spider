        "Keenan Curtis found the values up though 577 in his undergraduate thesis (working with Jeremy Rouse at Wake Forest University). Keenan proved that if 3^n+1 is a sum of two squares for n odd, then n must be equivalent to 1 mod 4, that n itself is a sum of two squares, and that 3^p+1 is a sum of two squares for all primes p dividing n."
