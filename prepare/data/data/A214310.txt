        "Each 3 part partition of n, with the parts written in nonincreasing order, defines a color signature. For a given color signature, say [p[1], p[2], p[3]], with p[1] >= p[2] >= p[3] >= 1, there are A213941(n,k)= A035206(n,k)* A213939(n,k) bracelets if this signature corresponds (with the order of the parts reversed) to the k-th partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) order. See A213941 for more details. Here all p(n,3)= A008284(n,3) partitions of n with 3 parts are considered. The color repertoire for a bracelet with n beads is [c[1], ..., c[n]].",
