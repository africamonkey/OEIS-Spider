        "Not every three successive primes have an integer average. The integer averages are in the sequence.",
        "Not all of these 3-averages are prime: the prime 3-averages are in A006562 (balanced primes). There are surprisingly many prime 3-averages: among the first 10000 terms of the sequence there are 2417 primes. Indices i(n) of first prime in sequence of three primes with integer average are in A075541, for prime 3-averages i(n) are in A064113. Interprimes (s-averages with s=2) are all composite, see A024675. (Edited by _Zak Seidov_, Sep 01 2015 )"
