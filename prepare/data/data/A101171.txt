        "No more terms < 10^100. - _David Wasserman_, Mar 06 2008",
        "All terms are of the form t=d*b^k where b=2 or 5 and d divides s = sum of digits of t. Let m be the decimal length of t. Assume that k>=140. Then we have m>=42 and thus log10(m)<m/25. Since d<10*m, we have m <= 1+log10(d*b^k) < 2+log10(m)+k*log10(b) < 2+(m/25)+0.7*k, implying that m < 2.1 + 0.73*k. On the other hand, b^k must divide s*10^m, implying that k < log10(s)/log10(2) + m < (1+log10(m))/log10(2) + m < 3.4 + 1.14*m < 5.8 + 0.84*k and hence k < 37. This contradiction proves that no term has k>=140, i.e., sequence is finite. - Max Alekseyev, May 08 2009"
