    "comment": [
        "Any square can trivially be written as sum of two consecutive triangular numbers T = A000217, since T(n-1) + T(n) = n(n-1)/2 + n(n+1)/2 = n*2n/2 = n^2. But it seems nontrivial to determine the squares that can be written as sum of more than 2 consecutive triangular numbers.",
        "Some of these have two different decompositions of this form, e.g., 286^2 = T(13)+...+T(78) = T(75)+...+T(96), 826^2 = T(13)+...+T(159) = T(43)+...+T(160). What is the sequence of these numbers?",
        "The terms > 2 of A129445, numbers k > 0 such that k^2 is a centered triangular number, form a subsequence: they correspond to k^2 = T(n-2) + T(n-1) + T(n), with n in sequence A129444: numbers n such that centered triangular number A005448(n) = 3n(n-1)/2 + 1 is a perfect square.",
        "Terms > 2 of sequence A075870 also form a subsequence, namely the numbers whose square is the sum of four triangular numbers T(n-3)+...+T(n), with n given by twice the terms > 1 of A046090 or A182435."
