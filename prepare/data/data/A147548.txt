    "comment": [
        "It is easily seen that if m is in the sequence then phi(m.m)=phi(m)^2 where dot means concatenation. So the sequence b(n)=a(n).a(n) is a subsequence of A147619 and it seems that the nenzero terms of this sequence is an infinite subsequence of the sequence A147619. If 10^n+1 is prime (n must be of the form 2^k) then a(n)=0 because in this case there is no n-digit number m such that phi(10^n+1)=10^n=phi(m)."
