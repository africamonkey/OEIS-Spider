        "A single transposition error (of decimal digits) when recording or communicating such a prime still results in a prime (possibly the same prime). A003459 and A004022 (its subsequence) are subsequences. A003459 is also a subsequence of A068652."

        "3119 is a term because it is prime and 1319 and 3191 are primes.",
