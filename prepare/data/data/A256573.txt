        "\"God's Number\" is the maximum number of turns required to solve any scramble of cube. \"Quarter-turn metric\" considers a 90-degree turn of any side to be a single turn, while a 180-degree turn is considered two turns. Cubes of larger size than 3 X 3 X 3 are not solved for God's number."
