        "These are simple connected graphs with n+2 nodes labeled L, R, 1, 2, ..., n. The subgraph on nodes 1..n is a forest (no loops). Nodes L and R are both connected to some subset of 1..n and perhaps to each other.",
        "These are the graphs that can arise when one starts with a tree with m >= n+2 labeled nodes, some of which are colored blue, some are colored red and the remaining n nodes are uncolored. Then all the blue nodes are coalesced into a single node L and all the red nodes into a single node R."
