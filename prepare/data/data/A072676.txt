    "comment": [
        "This is a generalization of A072618. The integer n is in this sequence if either (a) 4n-1 and 2n+1 are prime, or (b) 2n+2i-1, 2n+2i+1 and 2i+1 are prime for some 0 < i < n. The Mathematica program computes a prime circle for such n. It is very easy to show that there are prime circles for large n, such as 10^10."
