        "A pandiagonal square of order 4 consists of 8 pairs of complementary numbers with the sum in each pair equal S/2 (where S is magic constant). For example, array {7, 113, 11, 109, 13, 107, 17, 103, 19, 101, 23,  97, 31,  89, 37, 83, 41, 79, 47, 73, 53, 67, 59, 61} consists of 12 complementary prime pairs with the sum 7 + 113 = 11 + 109 = \u2026 = 59 + 61 = 120 = S/2.",
