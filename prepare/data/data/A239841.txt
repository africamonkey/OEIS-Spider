        "Suppose G is the symmetric group on n letters. For each g in G, the set of f satisfying fgg = ggf is just the centralizer Z_gg(G). However |Z_gg(G)| is clearly constant on conjugacy classes of G. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem the size of the conjugacy class containing g is |G| / |Z_g(G)|. Since |G| = n! and Z_g(G) is a subgroup of Z_gg(G) we see that a(n) equals n! multiplied by the sum of indices |Z_gg(G) : Z_g(G)| where the sum is over representatives of the conjugacy classes of G. Since the conjugacy classes of G correspond to partitions of n (A000041), this makes it relatively easy to find terms.",
