        "The minimal relative errors for the unit circle area approximation by the arithmetic mean of areas of an inscribed regular n-gon and a circumscribed regular A121500(n)-gon decrease (strictly) for these n=a(k) values. This results from a minimization, first within row n and then along the rows n of the matrix E(n,m) defined below."
