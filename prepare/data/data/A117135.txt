    "comment": [
        "It is easy to see that the product of the digits of a number does not exceed 9^(log(n)+1) (log is to base 10). On the other hand we can verify that the inequality 9^(log(n)+1) < n/10 holds for all n > 10^43. Hence the sequence is finite. - _Stefan Steinerberger_, Apr 23 2006"
    ],
    "example": [
        "877 is in the sequence because (1) it is a 3-digit prime and (2) the product of its digits 8*7*7=392 is a 3-digit number."
