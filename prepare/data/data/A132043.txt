    "comment": [
        "A transversal matroid is a matroid whose independent sets are the partial transversals of a family of subsets of [1..n], while a bitransversal matroid is a transversal matroid whose dual is transversal. The principal (or fundamental) transversal matroids enumerated by A049312 form an important subset of bitransversal matroids."
