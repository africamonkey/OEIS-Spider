        "A self-avoiding walk is a sequence of adjacent points in a lattice that are all distinct.",
        "The truncated trihexagonal tiling or (4,6,12) lattice is one of eight semi-regular tilings of the plane. Each vertex of the lattice is adjacent to a square, hexagon and a 12-sided polygon with sides of equal length.",
        "It is also the Cayley graph of the affine G2 Coxeter group generated by three generators {s_0, s_1, s_2} with the relations (s_0 s_2)^2 = (s_0 s_1)^3 = (s_1 s_2)^6 = 1."
