        "This is the case m=5 and k=41 of the formula m^2*n^2 + (m^2 - 2*m)*n + (m^2*k) - (m-1). The most famous example is when m=1 and k=41 (Euler's generating polynomial). With k=41 the formula gives consecutive primes for m=10 and n=0..10, m=17 and n=0..10, m=86 and n=0..8. It is interesting to note that the sequences produced are all factors of the semiprimes produced by m=1, k=41. The other famous values to try for k are 5, 11 and 17 as these all produce primes up to k^2."
