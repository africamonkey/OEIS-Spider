    "name": "Given a row of n pay-phones (or phone booths), all initially unused, how many ways are there for n people to choose the pay-phones, assuming each always chooses one of the most distant pay-phones from those in use already?.",
    "comment": [
        "More precisely: The first person chooses any pay-phone. Thereafter, each person chooses the middle of a largest span of unused phones; but a span of length L at the end of the row is taken to have length 2L-1 and its \"middle\" is the outermost phone. If a span has even length, either middle may be chosen.",
        "Each person continues to use his pay-phone until all are in use.",
        "The problem was originally stated in terms of urinals in a mens-room."
    ],
    "example": [
        "From 6 pay-phones: A may pick any of the 6; he picks #4. B must pick #1. C must pick #6, since the others all are adjacent to A or B. D may pick #2 or #3; he picks #2. E may pick #3 or #5; he picks #5. F must pick #3. That gives the permutation (4,1,6,2,5,3), one of 36 possible permutations."
