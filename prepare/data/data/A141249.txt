        "These n are the numbers for which A141248(n) is odd. Note that n must be odd. When A141248(n)=1, the central point is the only point seeing the minimal number of points. These numbers are 1 or 9 (mod 12). These numbers also seem to produce cubic n X n X n lattices in which the central point has minimal visibility. Note that for n>1, n+1 is twice a prime power in A141250."
