        "A rough algorithm for generating terms of the sequence is as follows:",
        "1. Duplicate the middle digit of the number. If the resulting number is prime stop, else proceed to step 2.",
        "2. If the number has zeros in its left and right parts, insert an additional zero into those parts and if the resulting number is prime stop, else proceed to step 3.",
        "3. Add a zero to the left and right of the middle digit of the number. If the resulting number is prime stop, else proceed to step 4.",
        "4. Increment both zeros by one until they are one less than the middle digit. If one of the resulting numbers is prime stop, else proceed to step 5.",
        "5. Duplicate the middle digit of the original number and insert a zero between the two duplicate digits. Increment that zero until it is 9. If one of the resulting numbers is prime stop, else proceed to step 6.",
        "6. Insert two digits to the left and right of the middle digit that are one more than the middle digit. Simultaneously increment those digits until they have the value 9. If one of the resulting numbers is prime, stop, else continue step 6 with increasing distance from the middle of the number. (End)"
