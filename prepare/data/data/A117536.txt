    "comment": [
        "These correspond to increasing peaks of the absolute value of the Riemann zeta function along the critical line. If Z'(s)=0 is a positive zero of the derivative of Z, then |Z(s)| is the peak value.",
        "The fractional parts of these values are not randomly distributed; r = log(2) * s(n) / (2 pi) shows a very strong tendency to be near an integer.",
        "It would be interesting to have theorems on the distribution of the fractional part of the \"r\" above, for which the Riemann hypothesis would surely be needed. It would be particularly interesting to know if the absolute value fractional part was constrained to be less than some bound, such as 0.25. This computation could be pushed much farther by someone using a better algorithm, for instance the Riemann-Siegel formula and better computing resources. The computations were done using Maple's accurate but very slow zeta function evaluation. They are correct as far as they go, but do not go very far. The terms of the sequence have an interpretation in terms of music theory; the terms which appear in it, 12, 19, 22 and so forth, are equal divisions of the octave which do relatively well approximating intervals given by rational numbers with small numerators and denominators.",
        "This sequence was extended by examining the peaks of |zeta(0.5+xi)| between each the first million zeros of the zeta function. These record peaks occur between zeros that are relatively far apart. The fractional part of r decreases as the magnitude of r increases. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 19 2010"
