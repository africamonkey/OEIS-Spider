        "The m X m Wilkinson matrix is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. If m = 2k + 1, its main diagonal is k, k - 1, ..., 1, 0, 1, ... k - 1, k. If m = 2k, its main diagonal is k - 1/2, k - 3/2, ..., 3/2, 1/2, 1/2, 3/2, ..., k - 3/2, k - 1/2. In both cases, it has all 1's on the diagonals next to the main diagonal and 0's elsewhere. - _David Wasserman_, May 24 2002"
