        "Set k = n, take the k-th Xfactorial A048631(k) and find what is the maximum exponent h so that polynomial (X+1)^h still divides it (over GF(2), this can be computed with A268389, maybe also more directly). Set this h as a new value of k, and repeat. a(n) tells how many steps are needed before zero is reached.",
