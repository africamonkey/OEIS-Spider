        "If a(n) were converted to the base 1+floor(n^2/4)=A033638(n) then a palindrome would be obtained. Such palindrome is related to A215940(n!);",
        "a(7)=2541896 and A033638(7)=13, giving the palindrome \"6ACCA6\". Such palindrome cannot be converted directly to decimal, but it might be defined instead from these digits the polynomial f(t)= 6*t^5 +10*t^4 +12*t^3 +12*t^2+10*t^1+6*t^0, then evaluating for t=10, we get f(10)=713306=A215940(7!). 713306 clearly looks distinct than \"6ACCA6\". f(11) and f(12) respectively are 1130256 with \"7021A6\", and 1722942 with \"6B10A6\". Now evaluating f(14) we get 3646530 and if converted to base 14 it yields \"6ACCA6\". The same happens with f(15) converted to base 15, f(16) converted to Hexadecimal, and also in general for f(y) converted to base y, if it were provided that y>=13.",
        "Here A033638(n) gives the lower bound for the infinite set of bases where this behavior can be observed. For simplicity it is chosen the base A033638(n) when defining this sequence, although what we actually want is to keep the pattern generated by the products j*(n-j). (End)",
