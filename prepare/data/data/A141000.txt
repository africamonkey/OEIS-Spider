        "That is, numbers n such that there is a choice of signs s_1, s_2, ..., s_n (each +1 or -1) so that (i) 0 <= Sum_{i = 1..j } i*s_i <= n for all 1 <= j <= n-1 and (ii) Sum_{i = 1..n } i*s_i = n. (This forces s_1 = s_2 = s_n = +1.)",
        "It has been shown by Dick Hess and Benji Fisher that a number n >= 20 is in the sequence iff n == 0 or 1 mod 4. (For a proof see the Applegate link.) It is easy to see that n == 0 or 1 mod 4 is a necessary condition.",
        "Further comments from _David Applegate_ and _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 14 2008: (Start) An obvious greedy algorithm (working backwards) does the following: For j = n, n-1, ..., 1, let target_j = n - Sum_{i = j+1..n} i * s_i and set s_j = +1 if target_j >= j and s_j = -1 otherwise. This works unless we hit one of five exceptions, in which we must set s_j = -1 instead of +1.",
        "The five exceptions are when (j, target_j) is (5,5), (6,9), (7,14), (8,8), or (9,13). The algorithm also works for the more general case when the target total target_n is different from n, with the additional exception of (8,20). (End)"
