See the illustration of Kival Ngaokrajang's link given in A240926, where the first circles in the smaller (upper) part are shown. The present circles will lie in the region between the large circle and two of these circles in the upper part.",

        "For the proof for the first formula for a(n) given below use the formula for the curvature A240926(n) = 2 + 2*S(n, 3) - 3* S(n-1, 3) (see the W. Lang link in A240926, part II) in c(n) and compare with a(n) from c(n) =  a(n) + (4*b(n)/5)*phi. This is done by using standard S-polynomial identities like the three term recurrence and the Cassini-Simson type identity",
        "  S(n, x)*S(n-2, x) = -1 + S(n-1, x)^2 (here for x=3). This implies S(n, 3)*S(n-1, 3) = (-1 + S(n, 3)^2 + S(n-1, 3)^2)/3. See also the mentioned link, part III a).",
