        "A001844(N) = N^2 + (N+1)^2 = 4*A000217(N) + 1 is divisible by 17 if and only if N=a(n), n>=0. For the proof it suffices to show that only N=6 and N=10 from {0,1,..,16} satisfy A001844(N)== 0 (mod 17). Note that only primes of the form p= 4*k+1 (A002144) can be divisors of A001844 (see a W. Lang comment there giving the reference). Note also that if N^2 + (N+1)^2 == 0 (mod p), with any prime p (necessarily from A002144), then also  p-1-N satisfies this congruence. This explains why 10 = 17-1-6 is the (incongruent) companion of 6.",
