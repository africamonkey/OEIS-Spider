        "The rational value zeta(2n)^2 / zeta(4n) = A114363(n) / A114362(n) = prod(p^4n/{[(p^2n) - 1]^2}) / prod(p^4n/[(p^4n) - 1]) = prod([(p^2n) + 1]/[(p^2n) - 1]), where the product is over all primes.",

        "For small enough P, F(n, primes p > P) will be much closer to 1 than [(P^2n) + 1]/[(P^2n) - 1]}], so if Q is the value for which [(Q^2n) + 1]/[(Q^2n) - 1] = F(n, all primes) / F(n,primes < P), Q will only be slightly less than P, so rounding Q up to the next integer (for Q < 2) and rounding up to the next odd integer (for Q >= 2) should give P. The sequence identifies the lowest P for a particular n for which such rounding fails to give P, as follows:",
