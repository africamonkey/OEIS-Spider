        "The sequence is generated by a sieving method with iterated selection of intervals of the natural numbers as if they were forming a chain of contact points on which a stone could re-bounce once launched at some specific position at the small numbers.",
        "Image a stone with an initial kinetic energy t, which is diminished/dissipated by 1 unit each time it rebounds from the \"water surface\" of the residual sequence; it rebounds t times and sinks once it has slowed down to t=1. The numbers underneath the arcs of this flight, but not the contact points, are eliminated. We look at the limit of repeatedly skipping stones each time starting at new launching points with larger initial t. In detail:",
        "Start with the set of natural numbers. Let a(0)= t define t. Jump t positions to the right, erase t positions; from the last erased position jump t-1 positions to the right, erase t-1 positions; ...; jump 1 position to the right, erase 1 position. Go to the smallest i>t. Set t=i. Repeat.",
