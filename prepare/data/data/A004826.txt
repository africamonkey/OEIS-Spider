        "Stated in Lee, p.1: It is now known that when N is sufficiently large, the number of positive integers at most N that fail to be written in such a way (A022566) is slightly smaller than N^(37/42). Since any integer congruent to 4 (mod 9) is never a sum of three cubes, the number of summands here cannot in general be reduced. But of those four cubes, two of which (minicubes) need be at most N^theta, as long as theta >= 192/869. An asymptotic formula for the number of such representations is established when 1/4 < theta < 1/3. [From _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jun 29 2010]"
