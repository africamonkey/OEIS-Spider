        "The smallest integer which satisfies this is 210: It has 15 proper divisors (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105) and 4 prime factors (2, 3, 5, 7), so d(210) = 11. The square of 210, 44100, we would expect to have a difference of 72 between the number of its proper divisors and prime factors, and with respectively 80 and 8, d(44100) = 72 indeed. Checking this with further integer powers of 210 will continue to generate terms in this sequence."
