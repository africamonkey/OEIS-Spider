        "Given an undirected graph G=(V,E), its partition into strokes is a collection of directed edge-disjoint paths (viewed as sets of directed edges) on V such that (i) union of any two paths is not a path; (ii)union of corresponding undirected paths is E.",
        "So the case of undirected paths is the following.",
