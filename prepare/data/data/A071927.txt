        "The 103 prime numbers in the range 4457 to 5351, multiplied by 6, produce 103 terms of the series and likewise for the 33774 primes in the range 924493 through 1396393. There are likely to be similar long runs of a range of prime numbers multiplied by 6 further in the sequence. One could eliminate these by adding the requirement that n be primitive abundant, whose only additional effect would be to eliminate the first two terms of the sequence.",
