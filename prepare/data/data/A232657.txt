        "The very simplest example of the type of prime concerned is 43, but 100 (see Example) is the first value to produce 4 primes. 1000 is the first to do so in the fastest way possible. Proper concatenation first excludes 73 from this list, as the stem--initial--value in concatenation is itself excluded from consideration.",
