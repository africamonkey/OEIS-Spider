        "It appears (but has not yet been proved) that the terms of {a(n)} can be computed recursively as follows. Let {c(i)} be defined for i >= 4 by c(i) = 2c(i-1) + 1, if n is a multiple of 3, else c(i) = 2c(i-1) - 1, with c(4) = 1. I.e., {c(i)} = {1,1,3,5,9,19,37,73,147,...}, for i=4,5,6,... . Let a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3. For n > 3, choose k so that F(k)-2 < n <= F(k+1)-2, where F(k) denotes the k-th Fibonacci number (A000045). Then a(n) = c(k) + 2a(F(k)-2) - a(2F(k)-n-3). This has been verified for n up to 1100. - _John W. Layman_, May 26 2009"
