        "We may define the n-limit Pepper ambiguity, for any odd number greater than one n, as the maximum of the ratios of the errors of the nearest approximation to the members of the n-limit tonality diamond to the next nearest. In the 7-limit, that means we look at the ratios of the errors for the nearest approximations to 3/2, 5/4, 5/3, 7/4, 7/5 and 7/6 to the next nearest."
