    "comment": [
        "A T-toothpick is formed from three toothpicks of equal length, in the shape of a T. There are three endpoints. We call the middle of the top toothpick the pivot point.",
        "We start at round 0 with no T-toothpicks.",
        "At round 1 we place a T-toothpick anywhere in the plane.",
        "At round 2 we place three other T-toothpicks.",
        "And so on...",
        "The rule for adding a new T-toothpick is the following. A new T-toothpick is added at any exposed endpoint, with the pivot point touching the endpoint and so that the crossbar of the new toothpick is perpendicular to the exposed end.",
        "The sequence gives the number of T-toothpicks after n rounds. A160173 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.",
        "See the entry A139250 for more information about the toothpick process and the toothpick propagation.",
        "On the infinite square grid a T-toothpick can be represented as a square polyedge with three components from a central point: two consecutive components on the same straight-line and a centered orthogonal component.",
        "If the T-toothpick has three components then at the n-th round the structure is a polyedge with 3*a(n) components.",
        "From _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 26 2011: (Start)",
        "For formula and more information see the Applegate-Pol-Sloane paper, chapter 11, \"T-shaped toothpicks\". See also A160173.",
        "Also, this sequence can be illustrated using another structure in which every T-toothpick is replaced by an isosceles right triangle. (End)",
        "The structure is very distinct but the graph is similar to the graphs from the following sequences: A147562, A160164, A162795, A169707, A187220, A255366, A256260, at least for the known terms from Data section. - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 24 2015",
        "Shares with A255366 some terms with the same index, for example the element a(43) = 1729, the Hardy-Ramanujan number. - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 25 2015"
