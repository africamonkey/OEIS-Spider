The excedance specification for a permutation (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) is the sequence (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) defined by a_i = 1, 0, or -1 according as p_i is greater than, equal to, or less than i. If all permutations with a given excedance specification are arranged in lex (dictionary) order, then the first--and only the first--avoids the pattern set {3142,3412,3421,4312,4321}. - _David Callan_, Jul 25 2008",
