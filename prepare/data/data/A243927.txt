        "Decree that (row 1) = (1).  For n >=2, row n consists of numbers in increasing order generated as follows:  x+1 for each x in row n-1 together with -2/x for each nonzero x in row n-1, where duplicates are deleted as they occur.  The number of numbers in row n is A243927(n).   Conjecture:  every rational number occurs exactly once in the array."
