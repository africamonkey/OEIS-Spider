        "See sequence A163574 for further discussion, in particular the proof that n must be odd, and that there is no further term with less than 13 digits.  There are several options for representing the terms with 13 and more digits, e.g., continuing to write the number d[1]*10^(n-1)+...+d[n]*10^0, or concatenation of the \"digits\", written in base 10, even when they are larger than 9.",
