We have the following recurrence for the pair M(n)=[b(n),c(n)]. M(1)=[0,1]; if n=p(t) (=the t-th prime), then M(n)=[xc(t),b(t)+c(t)]; if n=rs (r,s,>=2), then M(n)=[b(r)c(s)+c(r)b(s), c(r)c(s)]. Then m(n)=b(n)+c(n) is the generating polynomial of the matchings of the rooted tree with respect to the size of the matchings (a modified matching polynomial). The tree has a perfect matching if and only if the degree of this polynomial is 1/2 of the number of vertices of the tree."
