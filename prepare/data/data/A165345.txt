        "The cells are the squares of the standard square grid. All cells are initially OFF and one cell is turned ON at generation 1. At subsequent generations a cell is ON if and only if (1) it was ON, or (2) exactly one of the four nearest side neighbors was ON, or (3) exactly three of the four nearest corner neighbors were ON, in the previous generation",
