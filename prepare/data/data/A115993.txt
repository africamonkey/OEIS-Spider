        "This is an upper bound to sequence A115992; I do not know whether the two sequences are equal. The proof goes by projecting a queen (see definition of A115992), i.e. an element q of {0,1,2}^n, to the element p(q) of {0,1}^n obtained by substituting 0 for 2. Let also D(q) = { q' in {0,2}^n | if q_i <> 1 then q'_i = q_i }; then |D(q)| = m(p(q)). Two queens q and q' attack each other if and only if either p(q)=p(q') or D(q) and D(q') meet. Conclusion left to the reader."

Total measure of S is 1+4*2+4=13, while {0,1}^4 itself has measure 16 and all remaining elements of {0,1} have measure >= 4 so none of them can complete S."
