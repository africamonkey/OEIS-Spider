        "There are 5 twin primes in a group of 39 numbers. The term 5TP39 was suggested by prime number researcher Roger Hargrave on 16-FEB-2003. It is also the lowest number of ten primes.",
        "We only have to test primes of the form p = 2310n + 821 and p = 2310n + 1451.",
        "Similar to A059925, but here we have additionally a twin pair of primes in the middle."
