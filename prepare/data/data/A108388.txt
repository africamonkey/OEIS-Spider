        "a(n) is a term iff a(n) is prime and binomial(m,2) 'transmutations' (see example) of a(n) are different primes. A083983 is the subsequence for m=2: one transmutation (The author of A083983, Amarnath Murthy, calls the result of such a digit-exchange a self-complement. {Because I didn't know until afterwards that this sequence was a generalization of A083983 and as this generalization always leaves some digits unchanged for m>2, I've chosen different terminology.}). A108389 ({1,3,7,9}) is the subsequence for m=4: six transmutations. Each a(n) corresponding to m=3 (depending upon its set of distinct digits) and having three transmutations is also a member of A108382 ({1,3,7}), A108383 ({1,3,9}), A108384 ({1,7,9}), or A108385 ({3,7,9}). The condition m>=2 only eliminates the repunit (A004022) and single-digit primes. The condition m<=4 is not a restriction because if there were more distinct digits, they would include even digits or the digit 5, in either case transmuting into a composite number. Some terms such as 1933 are reversible primes (\"Emirps\": A006567) and the reverse is also transmutable. The transmutable prime 3391933 has three distinct digits and is also a palindromic prime (A002385). The smallest transmutable prime having four distinct digits is A108389(0) = 133999337137 (12 digits)."
