    "comment": [
        "a(n), n > 6, is intractable, and a(6) requires extensive resources: There are 360 candidate numbers for any candidate prime, all of which need to be composite, prefixing 30 2-digit numbers and suffixing the 12 ending in either 1 or 5. This compares with 400 for base 5, but in the base-6 case divisibility by 2 and 3 are already ruled out."

        "In base 2--binary, decimal 2 and 3 have representations 10 and 11; and binary 101001 and 101111 represent decimal 41 and 47, so that a(2) > 3.  Binary 101--decimal 5--has the 4 binary candidates 1010101, 1010111, 1110101, and 1110111--decimal 85, 87, 117 and 119--requiring consideration for primality, but all are composite: a(2)=5."
