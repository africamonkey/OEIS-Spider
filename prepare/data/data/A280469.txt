        "For a given term n of this sequence, n-1 and n+1 are both squarefree k-almost primes for the same k. The sequence is thus the union of the averages (arithmetic means) of twin prime pairs (A014574), the averages of twin squarefree semiprime pairs, the averages of twin squarefree 3-almost prime pairs, ... (where \"twin ... pairs\" means the members of each pair differ by two). A subsequence of A280382 and of A280383."
