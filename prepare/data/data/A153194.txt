    "comment": [
        "Previous name was: \"For each number of the sequence, n, consider the fraction of squares from 1 to n inclusive. For numbers in this sequence, that fraction, when reduced to its lowest terms will always have 3 in the numerator.\".",
        "To obtain similar fractions as above with a numerator of 1, for example 1/5 are square, there are three possible numbers, namely 15, 20, 25. In general it is fairly easy to show that for 1/k of the numbers up to n (1 to n inclusive) to be square, n takes one of the three values, k(k-2), k(k-1), k^2. This sequence looks at obtaining fractions of the form 3/k. Another sequence (A153192) looks at the 2/k case."
