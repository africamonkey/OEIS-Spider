Buddenhagen_ asked: Which circles have the property that they pass through more lattice points than any smaller circle? and he gave the terms 1, 25, 65, 325, 1105, 4225, 5525, with the missing 5 added by Ahmed Fares. In the same thread _Gerry Myerson_ mentioned the factorization into primes of the form 4*k+1."
