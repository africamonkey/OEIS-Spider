        "Original name was: Maximum label within a minimal labeling of 2 identical n-sided dice yielding the most possible sums. For example, two hexahedra labeled (1, 3, 8, 14, 17, 18) yield the 21 possible sums 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36. No more sums can be obtained by different labelings, and no labeling with labels < 18 yields 21 possible sums. Therefore a(6) = 18.",
