        "Apparently Gardner (1975) quotes Papaikonomou as showing that there can be at most one solution for a given n. However, this is incorrect: see A096680 for n values with more than one such permutation. - _Ray Chandler_",
        "For any n, the number of permutations is permanent(m), where the n X n matrix m is defined m(i,j) = 1 or 0, depending on whether i+j is a cube or not. Hence, n is in this sequence if permanent(m) > 0."
