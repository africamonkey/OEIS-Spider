    "name": "After the first two terms, each subsequent term is the smallest integer that is an outlier of the previous dataset, based on the criterion of 3 sample standard deviations above the mean.",
    "comment": [
        "This sequence depends on the initial two values and the definition of outlier: whether to use the sample or population standard deviation and how many standard deviations above the mean."
    ],
    "formula": [
        "a(n) = int(m(n-1) + 3s(n-1) + 1), where m(n-1) is the arithmetic mean of the first n-1 terms and s(n-1) is the sample standard deviation of the first n-1 terms"
    ],
    "example": [
        "a(5) = 12 because the mean of the first 4 terms is 3.5 and the sample standard deviation is 2.65, so the lower limit to any outlier is 11.45 and the next higher integer is 12."
