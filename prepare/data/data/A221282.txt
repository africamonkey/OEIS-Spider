    "comment": [
        "Hildebrand proved that each of the 8 possible 3-tuples of values +1 and -1 occur infinitely often as values of the Liouville function at consecutive arguments. It seems difficult to extend Hildebrand's result to patterns of length larger than 3. However, for results in this direction see Buttkewitz & Elsholtz."
