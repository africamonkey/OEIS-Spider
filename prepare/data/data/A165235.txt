    "comment": [
        "The n+1 primes have common differences of 2^k for k=1..n. For any n, the set {2^k - 2, k=1..n+1} is admissible. Hence by the prime k-tuple conjecture, an infinite number of primes p should exist for each n. Note that a(1) is the first term of the twin primes A001359 and a(2) is the first term of prime triples A022004. The a(12) term is greater than 10^12."
