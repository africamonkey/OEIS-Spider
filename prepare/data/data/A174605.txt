        "Partial sums of n minus (number of 1's in binary expansion of n). Partial sums of highest power of 2 dividing n!. The subsequence of powers of 2 in the partial sum begins: 1, 2, 8, 16, no more through a(72) = 2414. The subsequence of primes in the partial sum begins: 2, 5, 23, 103, no more through a(72)= 2414.
