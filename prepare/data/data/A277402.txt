        "I like the name \"portolan numbers\": cf. the rhumbline designs on medieval maps, constructed in a similar way.",
        "The regions can be counted using an adaptation of Smiley and Wick's method in A092098: count regions assuming there are no redundant intersections, then subtract the number of regions that Ceva's Theorem says must vanish.",
        "Off-diagonal redundant intersections occur for triples of integers 1 <= i, j, k < floor(n/2)-1 such that M(i)*M(j) = M(k), where M(x) is the ratio (sin(Pi(n-x)/(3n)))/(sin(Pi*x/(3n))). In the case 10|n, this corresponds to the charming identity (sin(7Pi/30) sin(8Pi/30))/(sin(3Pi/30) sin(2Pi/30)) = (sin(9Pi/30))/(sin(1Pi/30)).",
        "Differs from A092098 (which counts regions when *sides*, not angles, are n-sected) for the first time at the tenth term.",
        "The above equation has solutions if and only if 10|n. This can be shown by rewriting the equation in exponential form, and using facts about vanishing sums of roots of unity to narrow the possibilities for n.(See Conway and Jones 1976.) This is computationally feasible because A273096(6) = 1. - _Ethan Beihl_, Nov 26 2016"
