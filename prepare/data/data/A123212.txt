    "comment": [
        "If we take the cardinality of the set S(n) instead of the sum, we get the Fibonacci numbers 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,... If the set mapping uses x -> x, 2x and 3x instead of x -> x, 2x, anx x^2, the corrresponding sequence consists of the Stirling numbers of the second kind 1,6,25,90,301,966,3025,... (A000392)."
