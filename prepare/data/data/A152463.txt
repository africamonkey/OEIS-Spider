        "Multiplying by 5^2 and making the substitution x' = 5x, y' = 5y we get a Mordell curve y'^2 = x'^3 + 100, for which we can find solutions in one of the text files at the J. Gebel link. We are interested in solutions divisible by 5, and up to a sign there are only 4 of them. So the list is complete. - _Max Alekseyev_, Dec 05 2008"
