        "Sequences A067369, A067370 and A067318 are related, A067318=A067369+A067370. A067318 counts transpositions in the symmetric group, denoted S_n. One can think of the transpositions in S_n as being split between the alternating group A_n and its complement, which we call the periphery and denote P_N. For n>=3, A067369 v(P_N) and A067370 v(A_n) always differ by (n-2)! When n is odd, v(A_n) is larger; when n is even, v(P_N) is larger. This gives new meaning to the name alternating group. The average weight of permutation in A_n converges with the average weight for a permutation in P_N at infinity."
