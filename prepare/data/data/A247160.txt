        "Players A and B bet in a k-round game. Player A has an initial amount of money n. In each round, player A can wager an integer between 0 and what he has. Player A then gains or loses an amount equal to his wager depending on whether player B lets him win or lose. Player B tries to minimize player A's money at the end. The number of rounds player A can lose is r. a(n) is the maximum amount of money player A can have at the end of the game for k = 4 and r = 3. Note that with a(0)=0, a(n+1)-a(n) is a periodic function of n with value = 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2."
