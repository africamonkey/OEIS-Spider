        "a(n) is also the number of non-isomorphic n-vertex undirected graphs forming an odd cycle with any number of degree-1 vertices attached to each cycle vertex. To transform a necklace into a graph of this type, create a cycle vertex for each white bead and a pendant vertex for each red bead, with each pendant vertex attached to the next clockwise cycle vertex. Since these are exactly the graphs of the n-vertex and n-edge linear thrackles, a(n) is also the number of non-isomorphic linear thrackles.",
        "For any n there is a unique n-bead necklace where the number of white beads is 1. Hence this sequence is one less than the number of n-bead (0,1) bracelets with an odd number of 0's. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Feb 28 2017"
