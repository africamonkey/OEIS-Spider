        "Or, odd integers k such that k + 2*p is composite for all primes p, q with 2*p + q = k. By the Lemoine-Levy conjecture, for every odd k>5, there are primes p and q such that k=2*p+q. Numbers 1,3,5 formally satisfy the condition.",
        "The sequence is an analog of A284919 for odd numbers.",
        "Conjecture: k=59 and k=151 are the only terms k>5 satisfying the additional condition that k + 2*q is composite for every prime p,q such that 2*p+q=k.",
        "This conjecture arose from the calculations up to 500001 by _Peter J. C. Moses_ and confirmed by _M. F. Hasler_.",
