    "name": "The number n written using a minimizing algorithm in the base where the values of the places are 1 and primes.",
    "comment": [
        "Any nonnegative number can be written as a sum of distinct primes + e, where e is 0 or 1 (See A007924 that uses a greedy algorithm for writing n). However in this sequence a(n) is generated by using a minimizing algorithm that gives the smallest binary vector for select members from the sequence Q = (1 union primes) that when summed gives n. Without the minimizing condition there is ambiguity - for example 8 = 7+1 = 5+3 = 5+2+1 has three representations."
