    "comment": [
        "Asking for 2^n different values implies that a(n) differs from all a(k), k<n and in view of the minimality condition, also that a(n) > a(n-1) for n>1.",
        "Note that a(n) is close to, but not always larger than sum(a(k),k=1..n-1), as opposed to the case in A064934."

    "example": [
        "Up to a(4)=16, we have a(n)=n^2.",
        "But since 5^2=25=9+16 is already represented as sum of earlier terms, this is excluded, while a(5)=6^2=36 has the required property.",
        "Obviously, any square larger to the sum of all preceding terms leads to enough new terms, thus a(n) <= floor( sqrt( sum(a(k),k=1..n-1))+1)^2.",
        "But in contrast to A064934, such a simple formula (with equality) cannot be used here:",
        "a(7)=12^2=144 < 147=sum(a(k),k<7) and also a(10)=sum(a(k),k<10)-84."
