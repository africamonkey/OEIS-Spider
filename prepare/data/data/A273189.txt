        "The multiplying factor 6 (in the recursion formulas below) appears to come from the ratio of b(1)/b(0) of the sequence. Each of the lines of tables (V vs VII) or (VI vs VIII) in oddwheel.com/ImaginaryB.html generates this factor.",
        "k is obtained from the difference of the offsets of two relate sequences. this one, (II), starting at 51 and a second, (I), at 99 (to be submitted separately). Thus, k =[Ic(n)- IIc(n)]*2. When n=0, Ic(0)=99 and IIc(0)=51 giving the value for k of (99-51)*2=96. Furthermore, k is the same constant number for any value of n.",
