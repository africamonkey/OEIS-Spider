        "The cellular automaton of A194270 contains a large number of distinct polygonal shapes. For simplicity we also call polygonal shapes \"polygons\".",
        "In order to construct this sequence we use the following rules:",
        "- Consider only the convex polygons and the concave polygons. Self-intersecting polygons are not counted. (Note that some polygons contain in their body a toothpick or D-toothpick with an exposed endpoint; that element is not a part of the perimeter of the polygon.)",
        "- If two polygons have the same shape but they have different size then these polygons must be counted as distinct polygonal shapes.",
        "- The reflected shapes of asymmetric polygons, both with the same area, must be counted as distinct polygonal shapes.",
