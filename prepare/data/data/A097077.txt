    "comment": [
        "These numbers are divisible by 7 if the number of repeat digits d, is not a multiple of 6. Given the Sum = ((10^d)^6 - 1))/(10^d-1) from Fermat's little theorem, we note that (10^d)^(7-1) == 1 (mod 7) as required. The case when the repeat digits d = 6k we have the denominator of the Sum (10^k)^6 - 1 which by Fermat's little theorem again is divisible by 7. Thus 7 is canceled from the Sum and the sum is then not divisible by 7. It remains to prove this last statement. Also it appears 7 divides (10^k)^6 q+1 times when k = a*7^q. Obviously this method could be extended to divisibility by any prime."
