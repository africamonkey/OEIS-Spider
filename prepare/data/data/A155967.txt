        "Note that composites can also be self-dual under this bitwise transpose transformation, i.e. 283 (base 10) = 100011011 (base 2) whose row-by-row matrix is [100,011,011] which is invariant under the transpose. Hence the basic sequence can be called \"primes which are fixed points under binary matrix transpose.\" What are some nontrivial solutions base 10? Base k for other k?",

Note that such numbers are either self-dual or have a distinct dual, so a(2) = 13. a(3) = 257 because 257 (base 2) = 100000001, whose bit-transpose is itself (a self-dual binary prime). a(4) = 271 because 271 (base 2) = 100001111, which is by rows [100,001,111], which when read by columns is 101001011 and that (base 2) is 331, a prime and the dual, equal to a(9)."
