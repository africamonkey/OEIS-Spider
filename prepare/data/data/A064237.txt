        "229 is another term because 613^2 divides 229!+1. See A115091 for primes whose square divides m!+1 for some m. An examination of the factorizations of m!+1 for m<=100 found no additional squares. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 01 2006",
        "562 is also a term because 562!+1 is divisible by 563^2. - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Mar 30 2004",
        "Comment from Francois BRUNAULT, Nov 23 2008: A web search reveals that for 1 <= n <= 228 there are 82 values of n for which n! + 1 has not been completely factored (the smallest is n=103), so showing that 229 and 562 are indeed the next two terms will be a huge task. I checked that n!+1 is not divisible by p^2 for n <= 1000 and prime p < 10^8.",
