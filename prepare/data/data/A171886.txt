        "Partial sums of binomial coefficients were considered in section 2.2 of the 1964 paper by Leech. The presence of the number 279 corresponds to the existence of the Golay perfect code of length 23.",
        "In general, A000217(n+1)+i-1 is in this sequence IFF the first i items in row n of Pascal's triangle add up to a power of 2.",
        "Almost all members of this sequence are \"trivial\" terms of four types: A000217(i); A000217(i)+1, A000217(i)+i, and A000217(2i+1)+i for all integers i. 279 is the sole nontrivial term.",
        "The existence of members of this sequence is of course crucial in the study of the existence of perfect binary codes - see the references. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 24 2010",
        "a(230) = 4097 is another nontrivial term, see example. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Aug 08 2013"
