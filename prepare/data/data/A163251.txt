        "Let S(n,k) = (n+1)^2 + (n+2)^2 +... + (n+k)^2, n>=0, k>=2. S(n,k) is always composite for k=4 (2 | S), k=5 (5 | S), and k >= 7 (see A256503). So a(n) is the sum of 2, 3, or 6 consecutive squares. The smallest a(n) that cannot be written as a sum of fewer than 6 consecutive squares is a(7)=139. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 08 2015"
