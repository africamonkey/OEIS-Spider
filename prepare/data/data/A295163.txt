        "Sequence A025587 gives the starting numbers which \"break the record\", in the Collatz problem, for the ratio of the highest (even) number reached to the starting number. This sequence gives the corresponding highest odd number reached. That is, a(n) = highest odd number reached in Collatz problem starting from A025587(n) = (highest even number reached, minus 1) divided by 3. It is therefore monotonic increasing by definition, and also a(n)/A025587(n) is monotonic increasing by definition."
