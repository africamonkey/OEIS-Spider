        "For n > 1, a(2n + 1) = a(2n) because after the primes (2,3,5), all second differences are even numbers. It is not known if the sequence remains finite for all n.",
        "To give an idea of the size of the sequences, the largest prime on the sequence corresponding to a(12) is 1280522207.",
        "For a given n, the Mathematica program uses recursion to find the longest list of primes with second differences bounded by n. This is not the best language to use for this problem. Even n=4 takes quite a while. The program prints longer lists as they are found. - T. D. Noe, Feb 03 2011"
