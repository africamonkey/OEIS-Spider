        "For k=2, n = 1, we start with fraction 1/1. The new bottom is old top + old bottom = 1+1 = 2. Then we add 1 (old top) + 2*1 (old bottom) to get 3, the new top. So our first fraction is 3/2. Since these are both prime, n=1 is the first entry. Continuing with this fraction 3/2, we repeat the rule. The new bottom is 3+2 = 5. Then we add 3 + 2*2 to get 7, the new top. So our second fraction is 7/5. Since both numerator and denominator are prime, n=2 is the second entry."
