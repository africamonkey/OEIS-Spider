        "We map {}, a, b, c, d, ... to 1, 2, 4, 16, 256, ..., i.e., to 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^4, 2^8, ... . Sets with more than 1 element are mapped to the product. So ab (a shorthand notation for {a,b}) is mapped to 2^1 * 2^2 = 2^3. The topology is represented by the sum of the representations of its components.",
