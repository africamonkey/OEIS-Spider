        "By definition, this sequence enumerates a 'universal' set S of nonnegative integers: meaning that every finite binary sequence occurs as a consecutive subsequence of the characteristic function of S (viewed as an infinite binary sequence). The infinite graph with vertex set the integers and edge relation '|x-y| in S' is a countable random graph."
