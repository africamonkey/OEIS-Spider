    "comment": [
        "A modified Heron sequence is an increasing sequence such that every three consecutive terms (say u, v, w) of which determine a Heron triangle by using u+v, u+w and v+w as three sizes. A Heron triangle is a triangle with integer sides and integer area.",
        "Given u<v be positive integers such that (u, v) is not (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 8), (2, 18) or (4, 6). Then there is an integer w such that the three sizes u+v, u+w and v+w form a Heron triangle. Therefore infinite modified Heron sequence exists. We can construct arbitrarily long Heron sequences. However, it is still open whether an infinite Heron sequence exists."
