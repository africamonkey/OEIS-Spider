    "comment": [
        "All solutions to phi(x)=n! belong to the interval [n!,(n+1)!] and are listed in the n-th row of A165773 (when written as table with row lengths A055506). Thus this sequence gives the last element in these rows, i.e., a(n) = A165773(sum(A055506(k),k=1..n)).",
        "All terms in this sequence are even, since if x is an odd solution to phi(x)=n!, then 2x is a larger solution because phi(2x)=phi(2)*phi(x)=phi(x).",
        "Most terms (and any term divisible by 4) are divisible by 3, since if x=2^k*y is a solution with k>1 and gcd(y,2*3)=1, then x*3/2 = 2^(k-1)*3*y is a larger solution because phi(2^(k-1)*3)=2^(k-2)*(3-1)=2^(k-1)=phi(2^k).",
        "For the same reason, most terms are divisible by 5, since if x=2^k*y is a solution with k>2 and gcd(y,2*5)=1, then x*5/4 is a larger solution.",
        "Also, any term of the form x=2^k*3^m*y with k,m>1 must be divisible by 7 (else x*7/6 would be a larger solution), and so on.",
        "Experimentally, a(n) = c(n)*(n+1)! with a coefficient c(n) ~ 2^(-n/10) (e.g., c(1) = c(2) = 1, c(10) ~ 0.5)"
