        "All primes != 3 squared are of the form 3h+1 for some h. This follows from the fact that all primes != 3 are of the form 3j+1 or 3k+2 and squaring either of these leaves a number of the form 3h+1. So for primes < 10^n, squaring and summing gives a number equivalent to 9 + (3h+1)*(Pi(10^n)-1) = 9 + 3h*Pi(10^n) - 3h + Pi(10^n) - 1.",
        "This implies that the sum of the squares of primes < 10^n mod 3 = Pi(10^n)-1 mod 3. While not foolproof, this is a way of checking the accuracy of the arithmetic performed by the generating program. For example Pi(10^13)-1 mod 3 = 0 and a(13) mod 3 = 0 would indicate the chances are good that the multiprecision routine performed as expected."
