        "Previous name was: A coin is tossed n times and the resultant strings of H's and T's are arranged in a circular (cyclic) manner (i.e. the outcome of the n-th toss is chained to the outcome of the first toss). Then the above sequence represents the number of strings, out of total possible strings of n tosses (n>1), having no isolated H, (by an isolated H, we mean single 'H' which is preceded and succeeded by a 'T'), when the resultant strings are arranged and studied in circular manner. Illustration: In the following string of 10 tosses, 'HHTHTHTTTH', there are only 2 isolated H's, namely the H's at toss number 4 and 6. whereas in the string 'THTHTHTTTH', there will be 4 isolated H's, namely at toss number 2,4,6 and 10. In the string 'HHTTHHHTTH' there is no isolated H, as the H at the 10th toss when chained to the first toss, will no longer be the isolated H, but a triple H."
