        "Terms in A119616 are always prime if n is prime p and s2(p)=p, hence it is interesting to find composite numbers for which s2 is also prime. Relative values of s2 are: s2=47,97,163,457,733,2203,3733,7993,10723,11317,21313,22147,26557,33403,57283,61417,67153,79393,101467,149323,160453,162727,174337,272683,296827,318793,358273,432907,440383,486583,551767,639007,832687,843043,911917,961183,1152913,1202017,1277593,1322743,1375303,1462897,1567327,1824997,1878883. Otherwise the sequence s2 gives numbers which appear in A119616 at least twice (and conjecture is that exactly twice)."
