        "A standard dart board is divided into 20 sectors each subtending an angle of 18 degrees.",
        "The sequence is generated by considering the positive X-axis to be running through the center of the sector numbered \"6\" and defining this to be 0 degrees. A line co-linear with X is then rotated clockwise until each numbered sector is traversed through the center of the sector in question. The total number of degrees is summed as each sector is traversed."
