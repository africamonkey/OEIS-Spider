    "comment": [
        "For primes p, q, r the sum p^4+q^4+r^4 can be prime only if at least one of p, q, r equals 3. This sequence is the special case q = 11, r = 3.",
        "It is conjectured that the sequence is infinite.",
        "There are prime twins (11, 13) and other consecutive primes (7, 11; 1093, 1097) in the sequence."
    ],
    "example": [
        "p = 3: 3^4+11^4+3^4 = 14803 = 113*131, so 3 is not in the sequence.",
        "p = 7: 7^4+11^4+3^4 = 17123 is prime, so 7 is in the sequence.",
        "p = 11: 11^4+11^4+3^4 = 29363 is prime, so 11 is in the sequence.",
        "p = 13: 13^4+11^4+3^4 = 43283 is prime, so 13 is in the sequence."
