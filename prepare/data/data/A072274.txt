        "Given the n-th prime, it is occasionally possible to form the (n+1)th prime using the same digits in a different order. Such a pair is an Ormiston Pair.",
        "Ormiston Pairs occur rarely but randomly. It is thought that there are infinitely many but this has not been proved. They always differ by a multiple of 18. Ormiston Triples may exist but must be very large.",
        "The smallest Ormiston triple is (11117123, 11117213, 11117321), the smallest Ormiston quadruple is (6607882123, 6607882213, 6607882231, 6607882321); see Andersen link. - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Jul 22 2009",
        "The current wording of the definition suggests that the second member of Ormiston prime triples (cf. A075093) is repeated. Indeed, such a triple (p,q,r) corresponds to two pairs (a(2k-1)=p,a(2k)=q) and (a(2k+1)=q,a(2k+2)=r). (If they were listed as ...,p,q,r,...,  then the sequence would still contain both pairs as (non-disjoint) subsequences. But if that was the intended meaning, then one would prefer the title \"Members of O. prime pairs\" (or simply O. primes?). Under this assumption, a(n)=a(n+1) iff a(n-1)=A075093(k) (for some k) is the smallest member of an Ormiston prime triple (a(n-1), a(n)=a(n+1), a(n+2)). In particular this is the case for the first two elements of Ormiston quadruples, cf. A161160. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 11 2012"
