        "The continued fraction 4/Pi = 1 + 1/(3 + 4/(5 + 9/(7 + 16/(9 + 25/(11 + ...))))) (see A079037) suggests the recurrence b[n] = 2*n - 1 + n^2/b[n+1] with b[1] = 4/Pi. Solving the above recurrence in the other direction we would have b[n] = (n-1)^2/(b[n-1 - 2*n + 3) with b[1] = 4/Pi.",
        "Now consider this last defined sequence b[n]. It appears to grow linearly, (1) does it? (2) What is the limit of b[n]/n as n->Infinity? (3) How does the limit depend on the initial term b[1]? (End)",
        "From the recurrence relation, it follows that the L=lim b[n]/n satisfies the following quadratic equation: L^2 - 2*L - 1 = 0 implying that L = 1+sqrt(2) or 1-sqrt(2). - _Max Alekseyev_, May 02 2006",
        "Note that b[n]/n decreases, while b[n]/(n+1) increases. I speculate that 4/Pi is the only b[1] value such that b[n]/n converges to 1+sqrt(2) instead of 1-sqrt(2). - _Don Reble_, May 02 2006",
        "It appears that round( b(n) ) = floor((1+sqrt(2))*n-1/sqrt(2)) = A086377(n) = a(n). This is certainly true for the first 190 terms. Is there a formal proof? - _Paul D. Hanna_, May 02 2006",
