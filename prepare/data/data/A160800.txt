        "On the infinite square grid we draw a Fibonacci spiral starting with 2,2,4,6,10,16,... (Note that each edge has length = A000045(k)*2, for k>0). We start at stage 0 with no toothpicks. At stage 1 we place a toothpick in a orthogonal direction, in the center of the Fibonacci spiral. At stage 2 we place 2 toothpicks. And so on...",
        "The sequence gives the number of toothpicks in the Fibonacci spiral after n stages. A160801 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th stage. See A139250 for more information about toothpick sequences."
