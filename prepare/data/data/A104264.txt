        "\"There are approximately s(d) = (10^d)^(1/2) - (10^(d-1))^(1/2) d-digit squares. A random d-digit number has the probability p(d) = (9/10)^(d-1) of being zeroless (exponent d-1 as opposed to d because the first digit is not zero). So we expect p(d)s(d) zeroless d-digit squares.",

        "\"The same naive estimate can easily be generalize to k-th powers, giving the estimate s(d) = (10^d)^(1/k) - (10^(d-1))^(1/k) for d-digit k-th powers. p(d) remains the same. The resulting estimates have ratio (9/10)*10^(1/k).",
