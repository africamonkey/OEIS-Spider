        "19581212842 was discovered by _Martin Fuller_, Dec 06 2007 and proved to the smallest term by _Jack Brennen_, Dec 07 2007 (see link below)",
        "139136064116422 is also a term - _Dean Hickerson_, Dec 06 2007",
        "In contrast, it seems to be easier to find numbers n such that n^3+n+1 is abundant. The smallest solution is n=12210244 and there are 19 further solutions up through n=271870216. - _Hans Havermann_, Dec 05 2007. See A133373.",
        "I found the first 2331 odd primitive abundant numbers A with no prime factors -1 mod 6, then looked for k*A-1 such that int(sqrt(k*A-1))*(int(sqrt(k*A-1))+1) = k*A-1, where k = 103 to 18000001. The first k found was 4447 for A(2331) = 3*7^2*13*19*31*37*43*61*79*97*103 which gives a(1) = 19581212842 = int(sqrt(4447*A(2331)-1); the second k found was 17744401 = 379*46819 for A(2221) = 3*7^4+13*19*31*37*43*61*67*73 which gives a(2) = 681577964785. No solution primitive abundant numbers were found with prime factors -1 mod 6 in the range I considered. - _Pierre CAMI_, Jan 11 2008"
