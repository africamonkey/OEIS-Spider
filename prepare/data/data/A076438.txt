    "comment": [
        "This is the classic Diophantine equation of S. S. Pillai, who conjectured that there are only a finite number of solutions for each n. A generalization of Catalan's conjecture that a^x-b^y=1 has only one solution. See A076427 for the number of solutions for each n. Interestingly, the unique solutions (n,a,x,b,y) fall into two groups: (A076439) those in which x and y are even numbers, so that n is the difference of squares and (A076440) those requiring an odd power. This sequence was found by examining all perfect powers (A001597) less than 2^63-1. By examining a larger set of perfect powers, we may discover that some of these numbers do not have a unique representation."
