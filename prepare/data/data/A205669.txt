    "comment": [
        "This is a fairly optimal sequence for reverse-sorting an ascending list where N = 64. Requires 4.125*N comparisons. 4.125 is approximately equal to 2.28*log10(64). The operation performed requires a defined, substantial and certainly nontrivial amount of work which is repeatable for a list of any size."
