    "comment": [
        "Let T(n)=n/2 if n is even, (3n+1)/2 if n is odd. This function is the same as the one in the Collatz conjecture, 3x+1 problem, Kakutani's Problem, Syracuse problem etc. Then x is an element of the sequence iff T^k(x) <= x for all k. Several conjectures relating to the 3x+1 problem can be restated in terms of this set. For example: There are no nontrivial cycles iff the <= can be replaced with < in the definition of the sequence for x>2. x has bounded trajectory iff T^k(x) is an element of the sequence for some k. These two statements together are equivalent to the Collatz conjecture."
