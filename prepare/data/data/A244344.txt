        "Observation : it seems that the prime divisors of a majority of numbers n are of the form {2, p, q} with q = 2^4 + p^4, but there exists more rarely odd numbers with more prime divisors (example from Michel Marcus : 3955413 = 3*7*11*17123)."

        "582 is in the sequence because the prime divisors of 582 are 2, 3 and 97 => 2^4 + 3^4 = 97."
