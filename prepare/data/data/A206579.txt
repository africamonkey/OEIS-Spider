    "comment": [
        "The number 1 is the most common number in continued fractions of sqrt(k) for k = 1, 2, 3,.... Most of the terms in this sequence are the product of a prime and a power of 2. There are only three exceptions less than 10^6: 133, 253621, and 375181. Sequence A206580 gives the number of ones in each of these numbers."
