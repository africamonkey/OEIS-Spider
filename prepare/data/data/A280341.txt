        "Here the height is defined to be the number of halving and tripling steps required to reach 1.",

        "The heights for starting values 16 to 31 are: 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, 7, 15, 15, 10, 23, 10, 111, 18, 18, 18, 106. The unique heights are: 4, 12, 20, 7, 15, 10, 23, 111, 18, 106. Hence a(4)=10."
