        "All primes, except 2, belong to this sequence. This is because p X p magic squares, with p primes, cannot be derived from smaller magic squares. Otherwise p would be equal to a product of smaller integers. Also, since there are no 2 X 2 magic squares, we cannot have a (2p) X (2p) that could be derived from smaller magic squares. And also we cannot have an 8 X 8 derived magic square (see first example). So, this sequence is A065091 (odd primes) U A100484 (even semiprimes) U {8}. And A100484 U {8} is also A161344 (see second comment by _Zak Seidov_ there). So this sequence is: A065091 U A161344. - _Michel Marcus_, Dec 07 2013"
