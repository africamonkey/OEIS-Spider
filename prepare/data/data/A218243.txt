        "A triangle number m is an integer with at least one decomposition m = a*b*c such that the area of the triangle of sides (a,b,c) is an integer. Because this property is not always unique, we introduce the notion of  \"triangle order\" for each triangle number m, denoted by TO(m). For example, TO(60) = 1 because the decomposition 60 = 3*4*5 is unique with the triangle (3,4,5) whose area A is given by Heron's formula: A = sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)), where s = (a+b+c)/2  => A = sqrt(6(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)) = 6, but  TO(780) = 2 because 780 = 4*13*15 = 5*12*13 and the area of the triangle (4,13,15) is sqrt(16(16-4)(16-13)(16-15))=24 and the area of the triangle (5,12,13) is sqrt(15(15-5)(15-12)(15-13))=30.",
        "Given an area A of A188158, there exists either a unique triangle number (for example for A = 6 => m = 60 = 3*4*5), or several triangle numbers (for example for A=60 => m1 = 4350 = 6*25*29, m2 = 2040 = 8*15*17, m3 = 1690 = 13*13*10.",
        "The number of ways to write m = a*b*c with 1<=a<=b<=c<=m is given by A034836, thus: TO(m) <= A034836(m).",
