        "There can never be an odd term! Proof. Any odd semiprime is of the form p*q, with 2 < p <= q. Therefore p^q +1 is even. Also p^q+1 is divisible by p+1 and p+1 is greater than 3 and it is even. Therefore p+1 has at least two divisors and we are still left with the factor (p^q+1)/(p+1). QED"
