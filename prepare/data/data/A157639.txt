        "Consider an arbitrarily large lattice. Define S1 as the square having both X and Y in the closed interval [1,3]. From a single viewpoint at (2,2), every lattice point on or inside S1 is visible. S1 (including its edges) covers 3 rows x 3 columns of lattice points, so a(3)=1. Also, since an n-row x n-column subset of S1 that includes the one viewpoint can be selected for n=1 and for n=2, this 1-viewpoint example is sufficient to show that a(n)=1 for n=1..3.",
        "Define S2 as the square having both X and Y in [1,5]. Every lattice point in S2 is visible from at least one of the two viewpoints (3,1) and (3,4). S2 covers 5 rows x 5 columns of points, so a(5)<=2. Since a 4-row x 4-column subset of S2 that includes the two viewpoints can also be selected, a(4)<=2. Since no 1-viewpoint solution exists for n>3, we have a(n)=2 for n=4 and n=5.",
        "Proceeding similarly, every lattice point where X and Y are both in [1,23] is visible from at least one of the three viewpoints (14,14), (15,14), and (14,15), so a(n)<=3 for n=2..23. Since no 2-viewpoint solution exists for n>5, we have a(n)=3 for n=6..23.",
        "Together, the three 4-viewpoint solutions {(20,20), (21,20), (20,21), (21,21)}, {(43,51), (72,65), (58,80), (57,66)}, and {(28,34), (105,105), (34,99), (99,40)} are sufficient to show that a(n)<=4 for n=24..132: in these solutions, every lattice point where X and Y are both in [1,m], where m=40, 128, and 132, respectively, is visible from at least one viewpoint, and all four viewpoints would fit in a k-row by k-column subset of the m-row by m-column square, for k as small as 2, 30, and 78, respectively. Thus these three solutions demonstrate that a(n)<=4 for the overlapping ranges n=2..40, n=30..128, and n=78..132, respectively. Since (per an exhaustive search) no 3-viewpoint solution exists for n=24..132, we have a(n)=4 for n=24..132.",
