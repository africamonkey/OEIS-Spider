        "On the infinite square grid the diagram of regions of the set of partitions of n is represented by a rectangle with base = n and height = A000041(n). The rectangle contains n shells. Each shell contains regions. Each row of a region is a part. Each part of size k contains k cells. The number of regions equals the number of partitions of n (see illustrations in the links section). For a minimalist version see A139582. For the definition of \"region of n\" see A206437."
