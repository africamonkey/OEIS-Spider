        "if p[x]=k*Product[(x-a(i),{i,1,n}]/Product[(x-b(i),{i,1,n}] and a(i), b(i) and k are real and rational, then p[x] will be rational. If you keep the roots out of the interior of the interval (0,1), then Farey function on that interval will be relatively smooth as well. In this case the 1/4 root makes that impossible but adding an x for a zero roots ties down the zero end and the other end is at 2."
