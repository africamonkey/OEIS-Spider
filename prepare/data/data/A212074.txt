        "Consider the problem of finding all integers n such that the Pell equation x^2 - n*y^2 = -1 is solvable in integers x,y with y != 0. Beach and Williams found that there are 102662 such values of n in the range 1 <= n <= 10^6.",
        "Of these, 3531 \"exceptional\" values of n were not predicted by a certain list of criteria given in their paper. These 3531 exceptional values fall into 10 classes given in sequences A212074-A212083."
