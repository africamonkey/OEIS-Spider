        "It appears that all a(n) that are divisible by p^2 and do not belong to A090943(n) are of form 2k*p^2, where p is prime and k>0 is integer. Also all numbers from A090943(n) = {228,284,914,...} are included in a(n) because they are divisible by the squares of irregular primes A094095(n) = {103,37,59,...}. Corresponding prime p such that their squares divide a(n) are listed in A090987(n) = {5,7,5,7,103,11,5,37,7,13,5,7,5,11,7,5,17,5,13,7,19,11,5,17,5,59,5,11,7,13,5,23,7,...}. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Aug 19 2006",
