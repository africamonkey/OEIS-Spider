        "Representation number of the bipartite graph K_{1,n} (the n-pointed star graph), see Akhtar, Evans, & Pritikin. A graph G is said to have a representation mod r if each of its vertices can be given a unique label mod r such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the difference of their representation numbers is coprime to r. The representation number of G is the least r for which G has a representation mod r, see Erd\u0151s & Evans."
