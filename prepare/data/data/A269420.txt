    "comment": [
        "Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions suggests that average gaps between primes of the form 8k + 3 below x are about phi(8)*log(x). This sequence shows that the record gap ending at p grows almost as fast as phi(8)*log^2(p). Here phi(n) is A000010, Euler's totient function; phi(8)=4.",

        "The first two primes of the form 8k + 3 are 3 and 11, so a(1)=11-3=8. The next prime of this form is 19; the gap 19-11 is not a record so nothing is added to the sequence. The next prime of this form is 43 and the gap 43-19=24 is a new record, so a(2)=24."
