    "comment": [
        "For these odd primes delta(p) = A055034(n) = (p-1)/2 is squarefree, and therefore the (Abelian) multiplicative group Modd p (see a comment on A203571 for Modd n, not to be confused with mod n) is guaranteed to be cyclic. This is because the number of Abelian groups of order n (A000688) is 1 precisely for the squarefree numbers A005117. See also A210845. One can in fact prove that the multiplicative group Modd p is cyclic for all primes (the case p=2 is trivial).  [From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Sep 24 2012]"
