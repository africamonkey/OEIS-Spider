        "The degree delta(m) of the minimal polynomial of rho(m) := 2*cos(Pi/m), called C(m,x) with coefficient array A187360, is given by A055034(m).",

        "Because the mentioned Galois group is isomorphic to the multiplicative group Modd m of order delta(m) (see a comment on A203571) all m = a(n) values appear in A206551.",
