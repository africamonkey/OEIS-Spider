        "This is to Pythagorean primes (A002144), primes of the form 4n+1, as primes with prime subscripts (A006450) is to primes (A000040). Hence this is one of four related sequences into which every prime with prime subscripts (A006450) may be classified: Pythagorean primes (A002144) with Pythagorean prime index; Pythagorean primes (A002144) whose indices are of the form 4n+3 (A002145); primes of the form 4n+3 with Pythagorean prime index; and primes of the form 4n+3 whose indices are primes of form 4n+3."
