        "Integer component of the numerator of a close variant of Euler's infinite prime product zeta(2n) = prod_{k>=1} (prime(k)^(2n))/(prime(k)^(2n)-1), namely with all minus signs changed into plus, as follows: zeta(4n)/zeta(2n) = prod_{k>=1} (prime(k)^(2n))/(prime(k)^(2n)+1). The transcendental component is Pi^(2n).",
        "For a detailed account of the results, including proof and relation to the zeta function, see Links for the PDF file submitted as supporting material.",
        "The reference to Apostol is to a discussion of the equivalence of 1) zeta(2s)/zeta(s) and 2) a related infinite prime product, that is, prod_{sigma>1} (prime(n)^(s)/(prime(n)^(s) + 1), with s being a complex variable such that s = sigma + i*t where sigma and t are real (following Riemann), using a type of proof different from the one posted below involving zeta(4n)/zeta(2n). On this, see also Hardy and Wright cited below. - _Leo Depuydt_, Nov 22 2013, Nov 27 2013",
