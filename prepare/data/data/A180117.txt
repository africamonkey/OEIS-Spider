        "\"Triprimes\" or \"3-almost primes\" that keep that property when incremented by 2. Note that we don't care whether m+1 is also divisible by exactly 3 primes, as we first see with the triple (170, 171, 172). This sequence is to 3 as A092207 is to 2 and as A001359 is to 1. That is, this sequence is the 3rd row of the infinite array A[k,n] = n-th natural number m such that m and m+2 are both divisible by exactly k primes (counted with multiplicity). The first row is the lesser of twin primes. The second row is the sequence such that m and m+2 are both semiprimes."
