        "That is, these numbers n have the property that there is a polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients whose values at x=0..tau(n)-1 are the divisors of n, where tau(n) is the number of divisors of n.",
        "Every prime has this property, as do 1 and 9, the squares of primes of the form 6k+1, and semiprimes p*q with p and q both primes of the form 3k-1 or 3k+1. Terms of the form p^2*q also appear. We can find terms of the form p^m for any m. For example, 2311^13 is the smallest 13th power that appears. For any m, it seems that p^m appears for p a prime of the form k*m#+1, where m# is the product of the primes up to m. Are there terms with three distinct prime divisors?"
