    "comment": [
        "It appears that if n >> 1 the structure looks like an equilateral triangle, which is essentially one of the six wedges of the E-toothpick (or snowflake) structure of A161330. The sequence gives the number of E-toothpicks in the structure after n stages. A220498 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round. For more information and some illustrations see A161330. For the E-toothpick right triangle see A211964."
