        "On 3 elements ABC, some tower (Halmos, \"Naive Set Theory\" among many) that begins with the empty set can be written without loss of generality as {0, A, AB, ABC}. But we need to have sets B, C, BC, AC included somewhere too so that the thing is \"largest\", i.e., includes every subset of {A,B,C}. For ABCD, there are 3^3 ways to include B,C,D into AB,AC,AD,BC,BD,CD and 2^5 ways to include AC,AD,BC,BD,CD into ABC,ABD,ACD,BCD. So a(4) = 3^3*2^5."
