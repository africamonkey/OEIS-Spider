Hint for an independent proof:  consider the partition array A036040 for the multinomial M_3 numbers. Only partitions of n with number of parts m = 1, 2 and 3 matter here. Each partition defines a pattern for a multilist, like 2^1,3^2 defines the n=8, m=3 pattern [..][...][...]. The corresponding M_3 number 280 = C(8,2)*C(6,3)/2 gives the number of possibilities to form from objects, here R,R,P,P,P,S,S,S, lists of length 8 (the order is relevant).  If m=1 then M_3 = 1 and for n one has 3 lists [n times R], [n times P] and [n times S] (no winner), If m=2 or 3 each of the M_3(n,m,j) (j=1..p(n,m), the number of partitions of n with m parts) comes 3! times from the permutation of the R, P and S symbols. The sum of the M_3 numbers over like m gives the Stirling2 numbers. If m=2 there are always winners for each n (only two symbols are present in each list). If m=1 or m=3 there is no winner.  - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 01 2014"
