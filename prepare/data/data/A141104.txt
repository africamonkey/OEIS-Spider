        "Let a = (1,3,4,6,8,9,11,12,...) = A000201 = lower Wythoff sequence; let b = (2,5,7,10,13,15,18,...) = A001950 = upper Wythoff sequence. For each odd b(n), let a(m) be the least number in a such that after swapping b(n) and a(m), the resulting new a and b are both increasing. A141104 is the sequence obtained by thus swapping all odds out of A001950."
