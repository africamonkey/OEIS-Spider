        "Largest arguments of LCMs are taken form A000961 in order to give distinct LCM-values. Argument 1 is omitted. It was giving an additional start term, 1+(LCM[1]+1)=1+2=3, the first prime after 1+LCM(1)."

        "While LCM[1,2,3,4,5]=60 is immediately followed by 61, LCM+1 is followed by 67, as by a first such a prime, therefore a(4)=67 and not 61."
