        "This sequence excludes the trivial members of A089583. Note that all single digit numbers are excluded as they equal themselves when converted to base b+1. 3 in base 4 is 3 and of course divides evenly into the original value of 3. Note also that all numbers containing the digit 9 can only be interpreted as base 10 numbers, which of course divide themselves once and are therefore excluded. See sequence A089583 for the full sequence including trivial members."
