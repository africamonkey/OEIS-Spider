        "A positive integer n has exactly two representations as the sum of two Fibonacci numbers if and only if n is twice a Fibonacci number and n >= 4. Conjectured by _John W. Layman_, Dec 20 2002. Proved by Max Alekseyev, Mar 02 2007.",

        "(I) the sum of two equal Fibonacci numbers",
        "(II) the sum of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers",
        "(III) the sum of two distinct non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers",
        "Lemma. The two representations of m > 2 must be of different types.",
        "Proof. Two representations of m > 2 both of type (I) are not possible as 2*F(n) is a strictly increasing function for n >= 2. Similarly, two representations of m both of type (II) are not possible as F(n) + F(n+1) is a strictly increasing function for n >= 0. Finally, two representations of m both of type (III) are not possible as that would violate the property of the Fibonacci numeral system (the uniqueness of representation of all nonnegative integers).",
        "Consider all possible pairs of representation types:",
        "(I) and (II) are possible only for m = 2: 2 = 2*F(1) = 2*F(2) = F(1) + F(2) but m = 2 has more than two different representations.",
        "(II) and (III) are not possible together as that would again violate the property of the Fibonacci numeral system.",
        "Finally, (I) and (III) gives rise to the sequence of a(n) = 2 * F(n) = F(n+1) + F(n-1). QED (End)"
