        "These n are the numbers for which A141225(n) is odd. Note that n must be odd. When A141225(n)=1, the central point is the only point seeing the maximal number of points. Except for 1, these numbers are 3 or 11 (mod 12).",
        "These numbers also seem to produce cubic n x n x n lattices in which the central point has maximal visibility; see A141228. Note that for n>3, n-1 is twice a prime in A141246."
