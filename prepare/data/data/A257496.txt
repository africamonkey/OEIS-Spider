        "Take all the factors generated during the search for a home prime, put them together in the order found (just like when looking for the home prime itself) and test for primality. If it is a prime you have a DPHP.",
        "Further terms are 74, 75, 95.",
        "The number of iterations must be more than 1, preventing numbers such as 12 (12->2*2*3->223) from being a DPHP. - _Dana Jacobsen_, May 06 2015",
        "An additional restriction is that a number is not a DPHP if it appears as the result as a product in any home prime search.  So 25 is not a DPHP because a(10) => 2*5->25 => 5*11->511 => 7*73->773, and 25 appears in the process. - _Dana Jacobsen_, May 23 2015",
        "49 and 77 do not currently have known home prime sequences, hence it is unknown if they are in the DPHP sequence. - _Dana Jacobsen_, May 06 2015"
