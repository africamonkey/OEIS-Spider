    "comment": [
        "If n is a practical number and d is any of its divisors then n*d must be practical. Consequently the sequence of all practical numbers must contain members that are either squarefree (A265501) or when divided by any of its prime factors whose factorization exponent is greater than 1 is no longer practical. Such practical numbers are said to be primitive. The set of all practical numbers can be generated from the set of primitive practical numbers by multiplying these primitives by any of their divisors."
