        "Draw a square spiral growing by a unit line segment on each step, and at the same time, draw another square spiral in the opposite direction (again using a unit line segment) that turns after the first step (see example). a(n) is the number of unit line segments remaining after the n-th step. Note that overlapping line segments are counted once."
