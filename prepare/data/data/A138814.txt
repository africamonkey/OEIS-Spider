        "The n-th perfect number divided by 2 (A133028(n)) has 2*A090748(n) divisors, then this sequence has 12 members. First 6 members are the first 6 powers of 2 A000079. Last 6 members are multiples of 4th Mersenne prime A000668(4)=127. a(n) written in base 2 has n digit. See A138824 for the structure of this sequence."
