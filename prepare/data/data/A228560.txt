        "Starting with a golden triangle base length = 1 and sides length phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2, create the next golden triangle at the base of the previous step, i.e., sides length = 1 and base length = phi-1, and so on. a(n) is the floor of the curvature (inverse of radius) of the circle inscribed in each triangle.",
        "The golden triangles created by this process are the same as the golden triangles inscribed in a logarithmic spiral.",
        "The approximated logarithmic spiral can be formed by circle curvatures at the radii 1, phi-1, (phi-1)^2, ... which are the sides of bisected golden gnomons and center located at their related apex. The sequence of this circle curvature (rounded down) is A014217. See illustration in link."
