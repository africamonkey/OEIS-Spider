    "comment": [
        "The sequence is well-defined in that for each n the set of numbers with n prime substrings is not empty. Proof: Define m(0):=1, m(1):=2 and m(n+1):=7*m(n)+2 for n>0. This results in m(n)=2*sum_{j=0..n-1} 7^j = (7^n - 1)/3 or m(n)=1, 2, 22, 222, 2222, 22222,\u2026, (in base-7) for n=0,1,2,3,\u2026. Evidently, for n>0 m(n) has n 2\u2019s and these are the only prime substrings in base-7 representation. This is why every substring of m(n) with more than one digit is a product of two integers > 1 (by definition) and can therefore not be prime number.",
