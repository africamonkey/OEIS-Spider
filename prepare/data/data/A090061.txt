    "comment": [
        "Trivial permutations are identified as those where the permutation = n itself. Digit loss occurs when a permutation has 0 in the most significant position, which drops off, leaving a number with fewer digits. For example, when n is 3105, the permutation 0315 is excluded because 315 has fewer digits than 3105.",
        "In the first million values of n, there is only one term that is divisible by three lossless nontrivial permutations. That term is 857142 which is divisible by 142857, 285714 and 428571. Note that 857142 is equal to floor((6/7)*10^6)."
