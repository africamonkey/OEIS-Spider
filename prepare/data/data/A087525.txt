        "Theorem: If z>y are primes then z-y divides z+y iff z=y+2. Proof: Let (1) z+y = (z-y)k for some integer k (2) z=y+2m. We must add multiples of 2 to y in order to avoid z=even. Substituting (2) into (1) we get y+2m + y = (y+2m-y)k 2y+2m = 2mk y+m = mk y/m + 1 = k for k to be an integer m must be 1 or y. If m = y then k=2 and z+y = 2*(z-y) z+y = 2z-2y 3y = z contradicting z > y. Therefore m=1 and z = y+2m = y+2 as desired. If z-y does divide z+y we have z the sequence of upper bound twin primes."
