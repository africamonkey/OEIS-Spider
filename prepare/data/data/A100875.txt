    "comment": [
        "The 13 pseudoquadprimes listed are for primes less than 50000. There are 693 quadprimes less than 50000. So the chance is very good for prime p and p+4 to be quadprimes if p+4 divides p^(p+4) + 4. In general, if p and p+k are both prime then p+k divides p^(p+k)+k. If we do not know if p+k is prime and p+k divides p^(p+k) + k, then it is probable that p+k is prime. However, we get surprises such as for k=64 we get 32 pseudo64primes less than 10000 while k=40 produces 4."

        "If p is prime and p+4 is prime then p and p+4 form a quad prime pair. In general, if p is prime and p+k is prime then p and p+k form a k difference prime pair. If p is prime and p+k divides p^(p+k) + k then it is likely that p+k is prime. If p+k is composite and divides p^(p+k) + k, then p+k is a pseudokprime."
