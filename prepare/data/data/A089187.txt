        "This is also equal to the minimum number of ways to label each triangle of a triangulation of an n-gon with one of its vertices so that different triangles get different labels (minimum taken over all triangulations). E.g. a(4)=7. Suppose a 4-gon ABCD is triangulated with triangles ABC and ACD. If ABC is labeled B, then ACD can be given 3 possible labels, while if ABC is labeled A or C, only 2 labels are available for ACD and 3+2+2=7. - Johan Wastlund (jowas(AT)mai.liu.se), Aug 28 2007"
