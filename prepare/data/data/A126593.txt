        "Obviously f(k) < k for k more than 3000. The Mathematica program below calculates f applied hundred times for every number up to 3000. After that the manual checking shows that the output is the exact list. There are three cycles. First: 70, 129, 518, 290, 517, 162. Second: 5, 32, 12, 6, 64, 80, 257, 164, 82, 260, 69, 576, 224, 24, 20. Third: 98, 768, 448, 288, 516."
