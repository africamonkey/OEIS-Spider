        "The theory of dessins d'enfants was initiated by A. Grothendieck. \"In this work, using the matrix model approach... we listed all the dessins d'enfants with no more than 4 edges. There are two 1-edge dessins, both of them are of genus zero, fifteen 2-edge dessins, among them only one is of genus 1, twenty 3-edge dessins: 14 sperical [sic] and 6 of genus 1 and one hundred seven 4-edge dessins: 57 spherical dessins, 46 dessins of genus 1 and 4 dessins of genus 2. The total number of dessins is 134.\"",
        "Note: The fifteen for n=2 is a typo, it should be 5. The sum: 2+5+20+107=134 adds up if we replace fifteen by 5, and moreover, the section on 2-edge dessins lists all 5 (not fifteen) dessins. The correct version of this sequence is given by A170946.- Mark van Hoeij, Jan 23 2011"
