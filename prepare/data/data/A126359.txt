        "2801 is a prime in this sequence in base 7. The next prime in base 7 is 17207 but this exceeds the value of a prime in base 8, such that A(n) (base y) < A(n+1) (base y+1) < A(n+1) (base y), so the next number in this sequence must go to the next base 8, which is 4673, because the number after 2081 in base 7 is 17207, and 4673 < 17207."
