        "Refer to A247618, which is the \"vertex to vertex\" expansion version. For this case, the expandable vertices of the existing generation will contact the sides of the new ones i.e.\"vertex to side\" expansion version. Let us assign the label \"1\" to the square at the origin; at n-th generation add a square at each expandable vertex, i.e. each vertex where the added generations will not overlap the existing ones, although overlaps among new generations are allowed. The non-overlapping squares will have the same label value as a predecessor; for the overlapping ones, the label value will be sum of label values of predecessors. a(n) is the sum of all label values at n-th generation. The squares count is A001844. See illustration (\"vertex to side\" is equal to \"side to vertex\"). For n >= 1, (a(n) - a(n-1))/4 is A027383."
