However, Chai Wah Wu has extended the sequence out to 10^8, finding 481384 terms, the last one being a(481384) = 99998180. This sequence does not appear to be finite.",
        "The first terms of this sequence are just beyond A109326(5). It can be expected that at least beyond A109326(6) = 1000101024 there will be examples where N-prevpal(N) and N-prevpal(prevpal(N)) are both of order 5; these numbers could be termed to be of order 6, and so on. - _M.
