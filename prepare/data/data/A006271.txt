        "Note that 1 + sqrt(2) = (c + sqrt(c^2+4))/2 and has regular continued fraction [c, c, ...] with c = 2. With b(n) = A006266(n), it can be expanded into an irregular continued fraction f(1) = b(1) and f(n) = (b[n-1]^2+1)/(b[n]-b[n-1]), and numerator(f(n)) = a(n) (cf. Shallit). - _Michel Marcus_, Apr 29 2013"
