        "Changing the most significant digit to 0 is allowed. The problem (base 10) was posed by W. Sierpinski, published in 1977. There are an infinite number of solutions if a certain Erdos conjecture on congruences is true. a(2) through a(9) are proved minimal, a(10) has not yet been proved minimal."
