        "Let x and y be integers used to generate the set of PPT's where x > y > 0, x + y is odd and GCD(x, y) = 1. Then the PPT area A = x*y(x^2-y^2) and the lattice points lying on the PPT boundary B = x^2-y^2+2x*y+1. Applying Pick's theorem gives internal lattice points I = A - B/2 + 1. Hence I = (x^2-y^2-1)*(2x*y-1)/2."
