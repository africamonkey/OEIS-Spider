    "comment": [
        "Given 4 segments a,b,c,d, there is a unique circumcircle such that these segments can be placed inside to form cyclic quadrilaterals. There are 3 ways to place these segments: abcd,acbd,adbc.",
        "Primitive means a,b,c,d share no common factor.",
        "The area S = sqrt[(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)] where s=(a+b+c+d)/2 is the semiperimeter.",
        "The circumradius R=Sqrt[a b+c d]*Sqrt[a c+b d]*Sqrt[a d+b c]/(4S)",
        "The length of the diagonal separating a-b and c-d is (4S R)/(a b+c d), the other diagonal can be obtain by swapping b,c or swapping b,d.",
        "It follows that if the sides and area are integers, then (any diagonal is rational) <=> (circumradius is rational) <=> (all diagonals are rational).",
        "From empirical observation, the area seems to be a multiple of 6. (If so, the program could be modified to run 6 times as fast.)"
