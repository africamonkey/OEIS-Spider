        "Here we let p = 6 to produce the above sequence, but p can be an arbitrary natural number. By letting p = 2, 3, 4, 7 we produce A000975, A033138,A083593 and A117302. We denote by U[p,n,m] the number of the cases that the first player gets killed in a Russian roulette game when p players use a gun with n-chambers and m-bullets. They never rotate the cylinder after the game starts. The chambers can be represented by the list {1,2,...,n}.",
        "We are going to calculate the following (0), (1),...(t) separately. (0) The first player gets killed when one bullet is in the first chamber and the remaining (m-1)- bullets are in {2,3,...,n}. We have binomial[n-1,m-1]-cases for this. (1) The first gets killed when one bullet is in the (p+1)th chamber and the rest of the bullets are in {p+2,..,n}. We have binomial[n-p-1,m-1]-cases for this. We continue to calculate and the last is (t), where t = Floor[(n-m)/ p]. (t) The first gets killed when one bullet is in (pt+1)-th chamber and the remaining bullets are in {pt+2,...,n}. We have binomial[n-pt- 1,m-1]-cases for this. Therefore U[p,n,m] = Sum[binomial[n-pz-1,m-1], for z = 0 to t, where t = Floor[(n-m)/p]. Let A[p,n] be the number of the cases that the first player gets killed when p-player use a gun with n-chambers and the number of the bullets can be from 1 to n. Then A[p,n] = Sum[U[p,n,m], m = 1 to n]. - _Ryohei Miyadera_, Tomohide Hashiba, Yuta Nakagawa, Hiroshi Matsui, Jun 04 2006"
