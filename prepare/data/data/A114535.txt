        "The decompositions for 1 are infinite and trivial, obtained letting k=1 and m arbitrary. The representations for the other entries are: 127 = 64^2-63^2 = 7^3-6^3 = 2^7-1^7, 3367 = 1684^2-1683^2 = 34^3-33^3 = 4^6-3^6, 14911 = 7456^2-7455^2 = 71^3-70^3 = 16^4-15^4. Apparently there are no other solutions for n<10^9."
