    "comment": [
        "Any even value necessarily involves crossing through an entire string of numbers of the same length (10^k-1 to 10^(k-1)).  Since primes of this kind do not arise for any leading power of 10 less than 5, finding such a number is unlikely using current hardware and software tools."

        "1000999998997 is one of the primes described and provides a value of 13 in this sequence, with 1000000999999 providing the other (A227949(7) and A227949(8), in opposite order for the purposes of the FORMULA at that sequence (technically))."
