        "To represent a number in base b, if a digit exceeds b, subtract b and carry 1. In fractional base b/c, subtract b and carry c. The sequence consists of numbers which in base 5 only have even digits, or one more than such numbers."

        "10 appears since it is written as 20 both in base 5 and base 10/2. 40 does not since it is written as 130 in base 5 and 80 in base 10/2."
