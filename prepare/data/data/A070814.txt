        "For n > 10, a(n) = 2a(n-4). First, it is easy to show that with i >= 0 and k,m in {0,1}, a(n) are of the form 2^i*3^k*5^m. Factoring this sequence reveals the regular pattern 2^i, 2^(i-2)*5, 2^(i-1)*3, 2^(i-3)*3*5, 2^(i+1), ... which obviously has the property a(n) = 2a(n-4) for n > 10. - Lambert Herrgesell (lambert.herrgesell(AT)googlemail.com), Jan 09 2007"
