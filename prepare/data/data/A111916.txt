        "Connected cubic graphs on 2n nodes which can be partitioned into two vertex induced trees which are necessarily of the same size.",
        "They are called dual Hamiltonian because the cut separating both trees contains n+2 edges, corresponding to a Hamiltonian cycle in the planar dual if the graph is planar.",
