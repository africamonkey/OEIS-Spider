        "Consider a group of consecutive positive Integers : a+b+...+y+z = Average of twin prime pairs. Number 4:: 1+2+3+4=10, 2+3+4=9, 3+4=7. Total 3 possible combination; all 3 sums are Not averages of twin prime pairs; number 4 part of this sequence 1+2+3=6, 3+4+5=12 == averages of twin prime pairs, numbers 3 and 5 are Not in this sequence."
