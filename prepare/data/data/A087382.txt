        "It is interesting that these primes occur rather frequently early on but gradually diminish as the iterations increase. Some ratios of count of twin primes p and the occurrence of prime(p) also a twin prime is as follows. Index< Ratio 1000 .74 10000 .48 100000 .39 1000000 .35 Looks like it is approaching a limit."
