    "comment": [
        "Special graph models were constructed (Ibrahim, 2009) using an automata scheme involving some transition function defined on the Special (123)-avoiding permutation patterns reported by Ibrahim and Audu (2005; Ibrahim, 2008). The order of these special variety of graph models represents an improvement of the earlier models (Ibrahim 2008) in the study of the degree/diameter problems as used in circuit designs and analysis. The sequence represents the number of nodes (order) in this latest variety of graph models for primes >= 5."
