        "If the {s+t} sums are generated by addition 2 terms of an S set consisting of n different entries, then at least 1, at most n(n+1)/2=A000217(n) distinct values can be obtained. The set of first n squares gives results falling between these two extremes. E.g. S={1,4,9,...,100,121} provides 61 different sums of two, not necessarily different squares: {2,5,8,..,202,221,242}. Only 5 sums arise more than once: 50=1+49=25+25;65=1+64=16+49;85=4+81=36+49; 125=4+121=25+100;130=9+121=49+81. Therefore a(11)=(12*11/2)-61=5."
