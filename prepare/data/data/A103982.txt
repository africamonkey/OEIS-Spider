    "comment": [
        "Because the cubic polynomial for octahedral numbers factors into n time a quadratic, the octahedral numbers can never be prime after a(3) = 19, but can be semiprime (if n is prime and 2*n^2+1 is triple a prime, or if n is triple a prime and 2*n^2+1 is prime). A005900(37) = 33781 = 11 * 37 * 83, three prime factors with same number of digits. A005900(41) = 45961 = 19 * 41 * 59, three prime factors with same number of digits. A005900(57) = 123481 = 19 * 67 * 97, three prime factors with same number of digits. A005900(67) = 200531 = 41 * 67 * 73, three prime factors with same number of digits. A005900(73) = 259369 = 11 * 17 * 19 * 73, four prime factors with same number of digits."
